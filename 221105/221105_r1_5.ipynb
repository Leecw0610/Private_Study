It\\'s all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.And guess what? It works. Mostly.Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we\\'ve seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder\\'s sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing \"comic book to screen\" adaptation.Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that\\'s because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that\\'s the one thing Michael Bay wouldn\\'t approve, you don\\'t disrespect the military like that!'],\n",

DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of \"who is really a hero?\" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole.

       "  'No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of \"Black Adam\". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn\\'t take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it\\'s a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn\\'t stop... it\\'s a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It\\'s only problem - it\\'s so average; something we\\'ve seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn\\'t great, frankly. But it\\'s still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!So let\\'s get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a \"twist\" near the middle of the film. It\\'s not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who\\'ve seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn\\'t try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it\\'s more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to \"The Suicide Squad\" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say \"see look how brutal we can make this\" without actually earning the audience\\'s investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with \"look how powerful and ruthless he is\". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!It\\'s when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan\\'s Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that\\'s okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I\\'d love to see this iteration of the character return. I\\'m just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson\\'s physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn\\'t here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn\\'t like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn\\'s \"The Suicide Squad\" and of course a certain cast member from \"Shazam!\". I did love these little connections- it\\'s nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the \"Shazam!\" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It\\'s definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn\\'t stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder\\'s \"300\", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don\\'t even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn\\'t discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn\\'t memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that\\'s okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It\\'s remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- \"Avatar\", \"Black Panther\" and \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like \"Venom\"... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson\\'s \"Black Adam\", especially in a potential \"Black Adam v. Superman\" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!'],\n",

The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)\"],\n",

       "  8,\n",
       "  '\"Black Adam\" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019\\'s \"Shazam!\". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam\\'s rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character\\'s sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical \"with great power comes great responsibility\" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.I have to admit it\\'s quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he\\'s going to pick and choose.To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there\\'s extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn\\'t help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It\\'s just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.As the film is a spin-off from \"Shazam!\", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there\\'s also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn\\'t always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.It seems long overdue that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It\\'s great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn\\'t consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That\\'s not to say he\\'s always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate\\'s comic debut predates Strange\\'s creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn\\'t have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there\\'s any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like \"Black Adam\" doesn\\'t really offer anything better or worse than what we\\'ve already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from \"Shazam!\", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.I rate it 7.5/10.'],\n",

With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.It is better than people say.

My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters.

While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.\"],\n",

       "  \"For a while here there's a sense that DC, on one of its few and far between occasions, has managed to deliver a feature film product worthy of its source material (and extensive budgets) with director Jaume Collet-Serra managing to start Black Adam in a fun and exciting fashion that seems to suggest audience goers were going to be treated to something a little unexpected, something just slightly amended from the usual playbook of initial superhero adventures but then all hope and excitement is extinguished by a teenage boy and his ever-present skateboard.More on that later.A much-hyped production that its leading man has been championing for the better part of the last few years, Black Adam presents DC with one of its greatest chances yet to bring one of its more complicated creations to screen and while his natural charisma (that you either love or hate) is mainly squashed in a role that brings to mind Arnie from Terminator 2, Dwayne Johnson fits the bill to be our anti-hero Teth Adam but despite some impressively staged early action scenes and a narrative that doesn't always play to the rules set out for large blockbuster origin stories such as this, Black Adam is unable to keep the foot on the gas as some questionable narrative decisions and character inclusions halt much of the films progress in being a silly but fun popcorn munching ride.There are times here when you forget you're watching a Black Adam film with Bodhi Sabongui and Sarah Shahi's Kahndaq natives Adrianna and Amon Tomaz joining Adam's journey as he awakens from a 5000 year slumber to all of a sudden be battling unknown forces and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman led Justice Society, with these two characters playing large roles in proceedings to an extent they become a genuine annoyance and by the time Amon is rallying local citizens in one of the most cringe-worthy battle cries committed to celluloid before leading a charge on his beloved skateboard you know that Black Adam has failed to hit the mark.These glaringly non-important characters and plot diversions do in some ways mask other problems that become more apparent as Black Adam's runtime wears on with Collet-Serra's insistence on including either a blasting musical score or Spotify 101 pump up songs in all of his abundant slow-mo action scenes or a collection of underdeveloped characters that includes the films main villain and Justice Society members Atom Smasher and Cyclone other reasons why the film fails to go on with its various moments of promise, with one almost wishing we were allowed more time to get to know Adam or even Pierce Brosnan's Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson, who steals many of the films best scenes with one hoping the veteran screen actor gets a chance to shine in a solo outing in the near future.To be fair to all involved, Black Adam is far from the worst DC movie to come our way but in regards to promise and potential verses the final outcome, this loud, colourful and soulless outing is equivalent to the likes of Man of Steel and Suicide Squad as features that seemed to be set to shine only for poor decisions and weak directive decisions hampering any chance they had of shining on the big stage.Final Say -Not without its moments, Black Adam is hampered by an increasingly painful plot-line and even worse supporting characters that take away from the films early signs that it is looking to do something a little different than the usual origin story run-through.2 1/2 skateboards out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)\"],\n",

However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.'],\n",

       "  \"Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.\"],\n",

       "  \"Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.\"],\n",

The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan).

My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.\"],\n",

The opening could easily have been extended into feature length, but they didn't want to spend that long in ancient times, so instead it is a massive(necessary, yes, still, could have been trimmed down) infodump.

Remind me, where are the JL in all of this? Casting couch?The reason that the titular character of this did not appear in the first Shazam movie(and it looks very unlikely he will be in the second one, either, except maybe as a sequel-baity mid or post credits scene) was said to be so they could have enough time to properly explore his character, however, it would have made more sense for this to feature Billy Batson or Superman instead of the JSA.The action is fun. Occasionally, it does forget that it is essentially nothing other than meaningless flash, except for when human beings who are not invulnerable, do not have immense superpowers, are put in danger: those fighting against their occupiers, such as Adrianna(Shahi, empathetic, strong) and her son Amon(Sabongui, passionate).This features some brutal violence.

       "  \"George Clooney and Julia Roberts are two excellent actors and the Academy Awards they each won were well deserved. They are also two very suitable actors for romantic comedies, and if we accept the idea that good romantic comedies can be made with characters (and actors) in their 50s or even 60s, then casting them in the lead roles of a film of this kind may be a good idea. However, to make a quality romantic comedy something else is needed - a believable story that makes us resonate with the characters on the screen, possibly fall in love with them or suffer with them during the screening of the film. 'Ticket to Paradise' by director Ol Parker did not have the chance of such a scenario. By basing their film solely on the charm and magnetism of the two actors, the filmmakers have failed in their attempt to deliver quality entertainment. Clooney (at the peak of his charisma) and Roberts try their best, but it's not enough to save the film from the fate of a mediocre comedy.David (Clooney) and Georgia (Roberts) married 25 years ago and divorced 5 years later. Lily, their only daughter is finishing her law studies and a wonderful career awaits her starting in a prestigious law office. On the farewell college trip to Bali, the young woman meets a local seaweed farmer, falls in love with him, and decides to remain on the island paradise in the Indian Ocean. The two divorcees decide to join forces to convince their daughter to give up her marriage plans. The reasons are their own experience of a failed marriage but also the fear that the girl is destroying her life, at least according to Western or American patterns. The first 10-15 minutes offer the opportunity for funny exchanges of replicas, filmed with rhythm and using appropriately the technique of parallel frames. These are also the best comedic moments in the film, in my opinion. It is what follows that disappointed me.'Ticket to Paradise' reminded me of a tradition of American cinema in which the film fits very well. It's about dramas, sentimental comedies or musical films produced in the 30s whose stories took place in the world of the super-rich dressed in tuxedos, sumptuous dresses and fur coats. Spectators of those times, preoccupied with economic crises and - towards the end of the decade - with the danger of war, filled the theaters where charismatic heroes played by actors such as Clark Gable or James Stewart appeared on the big screens. With a few changes in scenery and dialogues, 'Ticket to Paradise' could have been made then. George Clooney is, by the way, the actor closest to the profile of the great American actors mentioned, and he is formidable in this film. But I think that his charm (and to a lesser extent that of Julia Roberts) are not enough to carry the whole movie. The relationship between the two is too predictable and the parallel love story between the two young people is completely missed. Kaitlyn Dever as the daughter is, I think, a terrible miscasting. At no point do we see her as an intelligent young woman making a sensible decision. The way in which the natural paradise of Bali is described is at the level of tourist clips commercials and the presentation of the local culture smella paternalistic Western folklorism. I understand that the intention of the filmmakers is here also an escapist cinema that disconnects its viewers from the problems of the day, but in the absence of authenticity and a somewhat believable story, the effect risks being missed. I'm afraid that only the joy of seeing George Clooney and Julia Roberts again and together is what will be left after watching this film.\"],\n",

A story which has been told before, just in a new setting, but it's less about the story, more about the charm it gives. Comfort movie vibes. A little amusing I was the only one my age, audience was mostly middle aged women and a few slightly older than that men. Last that happened was when I saw The Good House which that made sense, but this is a movie for everyone, guess most were there for Black Adam which I admittedly saw first.Immediately catch the drift as it starts with the ex-husband and wife narrating totally different views on the same events. A lot of snarky, witty remarks throughout, not entirely quotable, nor cringe. Reminiscent of the early 2000's comedies, refreshing to see now; it even had bloopers in post credits top it off. The last recent attempt at making this sorta movie was I Want You Back which didn't really deliver.It was just funny, lighthearted and fun. Fun to see George Clooney and Julia robert's in a now rocky relationship, their disdain for each other's what made it work. It's actually not about the goofy stuff and more of the chemistry the characters had with each other which is why I think they should have given us more of Lily and Gede's relationship at the start because I was never really that invested yet their relationship was the crux of the movie that connected everyone. I should be more invested in it all more really. Does have a few emotive scenes.On paper, it has everything that could put in the same category as 50 first dates, how to lose a guy in 10 days, the proposal, even some of both Clooney and Robert's old movies; but it just doesn't have that oomph to make it special, despite the right ingredients. So what's missing?Those movies aren't the best on paper, but we love them and that's why they're comfort movies. While this is a good movie, it's not a movie I love, but it's in a genre where that's important. I can't explain it, it's a good movie that doesn't necessarily hold a place in my heart.

I think that was due to the movie maintaining a constant eerie aura, it doesn't lighten up at any point. The somewhat novel story was decent, as well as the acting. Thought Smile was the best horror this year because it was an actual horror instead of just throwing some gore into psychological thriller; Smile was more of a fun horror to jump out of your seat with your friend and this was more of a scare you to death horror. I constantly had a chill in my tummy and had forgot what that felt like. Maybe this scares me more than Smile did because that was more reminiscent of other horrors like the Ring.Over recent years I stopped watching horrors because new ones didn't scare me anymore and I thought oh maybe I'm just older; but now that I've found something one that's actually scared me to my core I don't know why I missed this. I think exorcist horrors are spine-chilling because demons are actually real to you especially if you grew up around church, unlike let's say vampire, psychological or zombie slasher.Didn't give it a 10/10 mainly because plot progresses pretty generically, even the twist felt lazy writing, but the fact that this is scary is really all you could ever ask a horror movie for. It could have been more graphic too, doesn't have a lot of images that stick with you and maybe the pg13 rating was limiting. A few unanswered questions i.e. Why Sister Ann was chosen. The story also lacked depth, not that it needed much though; I love that the runtime is relatively short and it uses the little it has effectively. Loved that the movie leaves an impression, not just to scare you while watching it but for you to think about it later before you sleep.Also, hopefully not a spoiler but that scene in the ambulance with the rosary was so bad ass, the demon knew he was bossing it with that pose waiting for the door to open. Favorite scene even though it's another were we whisked past the gore.I'm so happy this lived up to my expectations because it was the first time I was excited for a horror in years and it delivered so check it out.

Featuring a female exorcist, something that is forbidden in the Roman Catholic church, this movie wants its audiences to cheer for the movie\\'s \"daringness\" to break new ground; the problem is the main character, played by the beautiful\\nJacqueline Byers, is the most boring, stale character known to mankind. A combination of poor dialogue and mediocre direction throws any believability and sympathy for this character out the window - Ms. Byers\\' acting ability doesn\\'t help either, though I can\\'t blame her when she\\'s working with a script this terrible. And not just her, but every actor and character is as boring as a high school trigonometry class - everyone is repeating dialogue that you\\'ve already heard in a million other exorcism movies. And no one seems to be adding any personality to their character or spoken lines.The story itself does have an opportunity to be interesting, but quickly devolves into a generic, predictable mess - complete with an utter lack of scares or clever exorcism sequences. Sure, you\\'ll see bodies contorting and people climbing up walls, but it\\'s not scary, and it\\'s nothing new. The movie tries to shock its audience through climactic revelations that, in a better film, would genuinely shock - however, \"Prey for the Devil\" reveals said revelations with all of the impact of a cotton ball to the face due to actors and actresses reciting lines with the enthusiasm of a reanimated but still brain dead corpse. So, in other words, you\\'re getting a story you\\'ve already seen done a hundred million times before, with plot twists that won\\'t even register in your brain because of the inconsequential way that they are revealed.I was also shocked by how poorly directed and edited this movie was; scenes feel scatterbrained and chopped up, almost as if the movie originally started with one tone but was edited to fit another. What\\'s left is a very uneven and rapidly paced movie that, while quick on its feet, is simultaneously as boring as can be due to the movie rushing its audience to where it wants to go instead of leading viewers there through an engaging plot and empathetic characters.Look, I can\\'t write any more about this movie. Please don\\'t go see it - I know for a fact that you won\\'t enjoy it. I was disappointed beyond belief, and so bored that, if I wasn\\'t going to review this movie, I would\\'ve walked out halfway through to spare myself from any further boredom. I didn\\'t like a single thing about this movie, and I will never watch it again.'],\n",

       "  'LIKES:The Pacing: I won\\'t lie, the trailers had me less excited secondary to the editing showing it being a bit politically correct. This made me think it was going to be a very boring, in your face, slow moving movie with only a few lively moments. Not the case for me in this movie. While not the horror driven path that many movies take, Prey For the Devil (PFTD) accomplishes an entertaining pace for this reviewer that\\'s easy to watch. It moves well, helping get introductions and plot in, without sacrificing the continued progression through the story they are trying to tell. Thus, the movie is not the snore fest, talking festival, the trailers made it look like, but surprisingly a mix of speaking and exorcising balance.The Sound Editing/Effects: Much of the movie\\'s horror element comes from the effects as to the story itself, accomplishing a lot with sound and lighting alone. In regards to the audio component, PFTD utilizes the mechanic well to establish the haunting, threatening, and disturbing tone this movie has to offer. Several times the movie robs the scene of most noises, turning into a silent tomb of merely breaths, scratches, and little bumps suggesting something is coming. Other times the stakes are higher, turning the focus to impending doom sounds as the beast they are fighting uses demonic powers to turn the room into a battleground. And other times it\\'s pure chaos, where vocal inflections and beastly sounds overlay with the human voice, which truly turns into that spectacle of exorcist movies, with a little humor in it as well. The point is, the editing worked for me and was layered to give different levels of creep factor that helped build the spectacle and give the Horror element you might be looking for this weekend.The Camera Work: Again, exorcist like movies have been done a bunch and often involve the same styles of shooting the film. While this movie does borrow a lot from it, what I enjoyed was how dynamic things were with the camera element. The lighting, or in many cases hindered and lack of lighting, add to the sounds and make things feel haunted and destructive. However, we\\'ve seen those filters do their jobs and that might be nothing special to you. However, PFTD was big on dynamic action moments during the exorcising scenes and it helped pull me into the moments a little more. It wasn\\'t just stagnant shots of someone in a bed, but there was much more energy, with angles transitioning well to really give more thrills to the climactic moments. I liked the changes and the draw into the movie and felt this was a very strong element.The Story To An Extent: Surprisingly even more was the story element to this movie. A good horror for me is one part scare and one part story, with the presentation making up a big portion for both aspects. In this film, the movie made a big attempt at the story and it actually worked for me in how much deeper they went than the trailers suggested. This film is very big on diving into the central character\\'s past, and helping shape her present giving reasoning, meaning, and focus to all the things at play. It was a very engaging plot to the extent of a horror movie, helping to give most of the players involved some stronger moments and casting that I really liked. True, there is an agenda pushed in, but it\\'s tamer for me and did not get in the way of the stronger elements that the movie started to integrate into the mix. It\\'s actually this element that is one of the strongest for this movie and what I think many will enjoy.The Acting: While not the performance to clean up at the awards, the acting is not bad for this genre at all. The top billed three are my focus, but my sentence of many hitting their mark is an understatement for the talent assembled for this film. Salmon is a great leading role for the purpose of the head instructor. His voice and delivery are solid, strong, and wise, with the nonverbal mannerisms to support the relationship his character and Sister Anna have. Madsen does well with her role as the \"opposing\" factor to the school\\'s religious tone, fitting that very strong, very condescending professor. And yet, when the time requires other qualities, she shows promise with moments and delivers the dialogue well to be inspirational and meaningful. Finally the star of the show, Byers! Byers was very entertaining for me and I give the woman props for just how much she did with the role. She\\'s deep and sentimental, though not the full level I\\'ve seen in other roles, but at the same time the rebel who plays by the rules. She\\'s funny and nice, but yet has that edge to do what she needs to help people. The mixture is a nice touch and I think she did well with all elements and interactions with the acting.The \"Action\" Scenes: I said above, but the action scenes were well done in this movie that is on horror. Unlike others that tried bringing martial arts and gunplay, PFTD makes the purging of demons have more stakes and oomph than many horror movies do. The entities have personality, the stakes are high, and the character involvement for the most part crafts these moments where you really wonder who will survive the ordeal. Various strategies have to be used, objects are turned to weapons for the demon\\'s defense, and the coordination gives more movement to the scene that increases the involvement of the agents.DISLIKES:Mostly Predictable/Generic: However, the movie is rather predictable and generic. The film uses familiar tropes, plot lines with slight rehashes, and cliché circumstances that are hard to avoid in the day and age. Even the twist should have been guessed, I just wasn\\'t thinking, but you can catch many twists coming as the movie is much more simplistic and popcorn munching. It\\'s fun nonetheless, but don\\'t expect any mind blowing moments in regards to surprises.Did Not Maximize One Relationship: There is one relationship to this movie that makes is quite large for this movie. I can\\'t say much to not ruin things, but PFTD has this one dynamic that is all about Sister Ann and they only minorly address it. There are a few lines, which are cheesy, that sum up this relationship, but given everything else it paled into why this relationship existed. It\\'s not movie breaking, but it is weaker compared to all the other things we\\'ve seen.Plot Elements Having Some Holes: Going back to the relationship aspect, the movie does have other holes or convenience factors to help smooth them out. There are arguments that go unfinished, relationships left unexplored, and other elements that are shallower given the stronger relationships we have seen. It\\'s again not the worst thing I\\'ve seen, but it\\'s a shame that the movie tried to put a lot of things in only to short sight them because of the difference in directions both take that it was not surprising to have so many gaps.Not Scary For Me: It has attempts at unsettling creep factors, and it has jump scares, but my experience in this film genre makes it difficult to get me. I believe other people may jump at the tale, but overall, this is not the scariest or most disturbing movie, probably also due to the PG-13 rating. If you are going for these elements, and you have experience with the horror genre, this movie is not for you this weekend.Character Utilization: It\\'s actually better than I expected, but, again not to the full extent they could have done. There are several characters that have their place, but their inclusion feels more of an add-on, second thought, or incomplete idea compared to others. The scholar is one person, who seems to be a challenge point she\\'ll have to work with, but it\\'s really not, and sort of mitigated to helping her address her path. It\\'s not awful again, but this character needed more given all she held promise to treat. Same thing with a rival priest who seems will be a pain in the butt, but then sort of changes tune several times with little screen time. That relationship was the more annoying one, given again the potential to make stronger connections and growth.Time Got the Best Of It: This is the thing that seemed to affect most of the dislikes, was the time management. Prey for the Devil really had lots of potential, but the shortcomings seem to be due to a time issue that the 90 minutes limited them to playing with. Many things seemed rushed in, there suggested more story elements to come, but then got cut, or just trying to push so much in such little time. Even worse, it seemed to set up for a sequel, which at the end suggests that some of the aforementioned limitations were due to potentially setting up for whatever is to come later on if the directors want to do another.The VERDICT:\\nPrey for the Devil is a movie that is more story driven than horror driven which may be what most people hate with this movie. True, there is agenda writing in this film, but it does not match the aggressiveness of the ads for me, and that is a big victory in how they made the story work. It\\'s got strong character centric stories, it has interlocking arcs that are better than most plots in this genre, and it just has an engaging pace that avoids being too drawn out. I myself appreciated the visual and audio effects to make the movie have the chilling tone, with exorcism scenes that were more involved than most in the recent times. Yet, the movie is nothing special in regards to originality, it has elements that feel incomplete, and the lower rating reduced the scare factor for the extreme horror people. As such, this movie is not going to be the most renowned horror movie or our time, but it\\'s entertaining for viewers like me. Certainly there is more time needed, and I can\\'t help but think this is another franchise in the making, but overall, I quite enjoyed the movie for what was presented. My scores are:Horror/Thriller: 7.5\\nMovie Overall: 7.0.'],\n",

Maybe even several somewheres. It's still worth clutching a significant other and gasping at, but you may also find yourself chuckling at the wrong moments as this cast of half-hearted priests and nuns slog through a mostly by the numbers exorcism film where everything happens just like you expect it will and the plot doesn't have to make too much sense.Jacqueline Byers.gives a muted performance as a tortured young nun with a flawed history, providing the odd tear here and there, but staying mostly on an emotional baseline, despite the ostensibly fantastic events occurring around her. Christian Navarro compliments her performance with much of the same, although he seems somewhat more genuine at times. Colin Salmon definitely takes point with tried and true acting chops, although he's relegated mostly to dialogue and exposition with little action.Without spoilers, this movie borrows possession tropes from all the big exorcism movies, dishing them out almost predictably, the most creative of which you can see in the trailers.The special FX are tame, and while the cinematography and lighting are solid most of the time, there are surprisingly odd flaws, like obvious drone shadows in the aerial shots, that really detract from the sense of being in a real theatre watching a major motion picture.Plot wise, you can guess this all the way through, and don't think too hard about things like how you can tell the difference between mental health issues and possession, how you can tell if an exorcism works or not, what exactly an exorcism requires or what the demon actually wants to accomplish by possessing someone. The movie doesn't bother to explain any of it, but acts like it does. Characters do mind-numbingly foolish things, walk into all the dark hallways go forward when they should run away, and even experience some consequences for the actions, and yet the movie seems content to leave our leads cluelessly naive and dull at each new turn of events.The moral/ethical subplots are muddy at best, making a case for women in traditionally male roles, then seemingly reinforcing why that doesn't work. It also makes a convincing argument for traditional Catholicism, then snubs it's nose at the same traditions as if unnecessary. Our heroes are mostly unsuccessful in their efforts, yet we are supposed to be on their team as they bumble through doing it their way against all better advice. In the end, I felt like the directory and his writers must have argued heavily over the religious and moral plot points, and compromised by not making any real statements or taking any sides, leaving a vacuum of blandly mixed signals that don't commit to anything other than a veiled hint that we are responsible for freeing ourselves from our own demons, but only through a confusing blend of faith, psychology and a bullheaded willingness to disregard them both and do whatever we feel like.It's a bit of a confusing mess if you want meaning, but it delivers on some jumps, some possessed characters, some inexplicable electrical failures, shadow grabs, etc.So don't be afraid to take your boyfriend and squeal on occasion, but don't expect any divine revelations. It's less like a blessed chalice of holy water and more like a stale glass of tap water.\"],\n",

She has a nursing position at a church hospital where the Catholic church - under the leadership \"Fr. Quinn\" (Colin Salmon) and psychiatrist \"Dr. Peters\" (Virginia Madsen) use scientific and ecclesiastic methods to treat their patients. The former leads their exorcism training regime and it to that that the nun is drawn.

Actually, the story here is not half bad - but the acting and the whole presentation of the film is seriously lacklustre. Sure, there are a few quite effective jump moments but as the story gathers pace it loses any semblance of plausibility. The writing clumsily muddles scripture and vernacular and the ending is really old hat. It has the ring of an over-stretched short story to it.

These sorts of movies can be done well with good acting and pacing The Exorcist for example or they can be done slower than a tortoise like this.Granted the filmmakers and actors are trying but the pacing is so sluggish I dont know how anyone could be entertained by this let alone find it watchable.The Halloween season of 2022 didnt bring any good horror movies. If you are looking for the best movie playing right now go see Till, it is a masterpiece but stay away from anything that looks remotely scary playing in theaters right now because you will only be scared by how bad these current horror movies are.Smile was also a fairly slow movie but its pace was as rapid as a bullet coming out of a gun compared to this.'],\n",

       "  \"It's hard to shake the uneasy feeling of this film. It's grim and foggy but at the core is the idea that when trauma is passed from person to person it will consume you. With that in hand, director Parker Finn plays on the idea that most people who suffer through awful events in life will have their past consume them if they don't confront them. Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a clinical psychologist who surrounds herself with the mentally broken people of New Jersey (add your own joke here). You can basically connect the dots as to how she became good at her job. One fateful day a girl comes into her office and gruesomely ends her own life. That launches Sosie's journey into her own madness. Slowly seeing things in her life. Or being haunted by voices of her past. Whatever it is knows her greatest pains. And exploits it. The mystery isn't completely satisfying to solve, but the constant moments of jerky jumpscares definitely make you feel on edge.What I particularly like is the uneasy camera work. It isn't afraid to linger long within the frame. Nor add dutch angles. It plays like 70's cinema. The frames make you squirm. Though much of the scares are telegraphed. This isn't a slasher gory flick. It's really a psychological mind bender. As mentioned before, the resolution won't make you happy. But then, it really is watching someone work through their own mental illness. If that is interesting to you, this is the movie for you.\"],\n",

I'm a 37-year-old man who has seen hundreds of horror flicks of all types. And yet this movie had me on edge from beginning to end. At points I was paranoid that someone was standing off to the side in the shadows of the theater.

I went in, as usual, without watching any trailers or looking up reviews/ratings. I had no expectations and was fully blown away. I was either smiling or had my jaw dropped for most of the runtime.I can't stop smiling at how impactful some of these scenes and moments are. I will never forget them. They are seared into my brain forever. Whoever came up with them, whoever designed them has to be some combination of genius and possibly disturbed. I love it.

Because it immediately gives us all that we need to get into the context of the film, not only in terms of the most classic horror elements but also in terms of its main themes. All this before its title card. But how? Introducing us immediately to our main character, Dr Rose Cotter, who works in a psychiatric hospital and who receives a visit from a new patient who in ten minutes shows strange behaviour, claims to be being followed by an evil entity, smiles scarily and commits suicide. And now that curse seems to have passed on to our Dr., who is impeccably played by Sosie Bacon, in one of those roles where she often has to balance herself on the boundary that separates what everyone sees and what only she can see.Trauma. It will always be traumatic to witness an event as dramatic and violent as a suicide. And it is from trauma that this entity feeds. And how well this theme is used... after all, many of us have gone through traumas and traumas are just kept in a hidden corner within us, always ready to be reactivated. Grief and guilt are often associated with traumatic events, and Smile does not deny that connection. Nor does it refuse to make connections with psychological and mental problems that can arise from it and how when this happens, the victim becomes even more placed on the sidelines, more isolated, more alone in a world from which one does not intend to move away but from which finds no other alternative.But of course, this is a horror movie and it's not only about the message that a film of the genre should live. Good news: even if you don't care about meaning, Smile is pretty good and effective entertainment. The suspenseful scenes are very well constructed, the environment feels heavy for long moments and it presents us with several jump scares that work perfectly, being this one of the scariest films of recent years.The film suffers from a certain predictability typical of the genre - I saw that ending coming from miles away - and, at times, it seems to rely a little too much on the power of suggestion and the effectiveness of its scares, although there are reasons for that because those are two areas where it stands out. The visual effects - mostly practical - are not present for long moments, but when they appear they elevate the work, with some really terrifying images. And as for Parker Finn...what a great movie debut, not only because of the way he leaves us on edge thanks to a very safe direction but also for presenting some elements that we don't often see in horror in terms of the originality of shots and scene transitions.2022 doesn't stop giving us good horror. Smile bets on a heavy atmosphere, strong messages and very effective scares to give us one of the tensest films of the year.

I wasn\\'t expecting some 11-time Oscar winning masterpiece, but I did expect an intense, edge-of-your-seat scarefest like that of \\'Insidious\\' or \\'Sinister\\', where the movie is dripping with creepy unsettlingness from start to finish. \\'Smile\\' is not that. What \\'Smile\\' does well is build up the jump scare, but unfortunately (and more importantly), \\'Smile\\' forgets to deliver the scare in each of these sequences it repeats throughout its way overlong 2-hour runtime.Example, the main character will be staring down a dark hallway while the music tenses and camera slowly zooms in, and then the phone will ring SO LOUD. This is NOT a scare! This is just lazy and, above all, annoying. These \"jump scares\" happen throughout the ENTIRE movie and are extremely obnoxious. I can respect jump scares if there\\'s actually something scary at the end of the build-up, not just an obnoxiously loud noise that has nothing to do with the tension that was just wasted. An example of an ACTUAL jump scare would be like when the Lipstick Demon appears at the table for the first time in \\'Insidious\\'. THAT is a warranted jump scare.The plot of \\'Smile\\' and the way the characters unravel it is almost identical to \\'The Ring\\'. No new ground is broken, which was expected, but I at least expected a little more originality than a copy/paste story of \\'The Ring\\' with a good amount of \\'It Follows\\' copied as well, yet is far less than both those movies.What I thought was pretty good was the ending, when the demon finally reveals itself. The design of the demon and what it does to its victims is actually pretty great/gruesome. Unfortunately, by the time we\\'re introduced to the Smile demon, the movie\\'s over.

The \"smiling\" aspect is corny and unserious, despite best efforts.

We\\'ve seen this story and these themes told a million times (and much better). The acting wasn\\'t that bad, but it\\'s also nothing to write home about.

And don\\'t even get me started on this being yet another film with zero explanation for the cause of its events.

Soon after this traumatic encounter (which ends grimly), Rose finds herself plagued by the same, much to the confusion and horror of those around her.I went into this film fully expecting a popcorn-caliber horror movie, and that it was--however, it was not a very good one. Despite a fairly strong (and creepy) opening sequence, I found \"Smile\" to be middling at best, and excruciatingly trite at its worst. The film takes a familiar concept (\"The Ring\" and \"It Follows\" are obvious major influences) but unfortunately does not do much of anything interesting with it. The \"curse\" bestowed on the lead character takes over her life and, as is the case with other films in this vein, leads her down a nightmarish path and a host of \"is this all in her head?\" scenarios. The plot devices used here have been done to death, which isn\\'t always a bad thing, but the film overall lacked the tension necessary to make a story like this compelling.A large part of what makes \"Smile\" ineffective rests in its rote and uninspired dialogue. Save the lead, the characters here are one-dimensional to a fault, and almost the entire supporting cast (aside from Sosie Bacon and Kyle Gallner, who actually offer sturdy performances) are abysmal--utterly stiff and unconvincing, which only further detracts from the lack of threat that should be at the center of the screenplay. The theme of the impact of grief and trauma is woven into the plot, which had the potential to be meaningful, but the overall execution fails this theme.All that being said, the film is not totally without merit. The cinematography is stylish, and there is a haunting score that rises and falls throughout, adding to the ambiance. As I noted before, Sosie Bacon gives a good (albeit not flawless) performance as the lead, which gains more vitality as the film the goes on. Unfortunately, it\\'s not enough to save the film, which culminates in an overwrought, silly finale replete with some audacious visual effects.While it offers a few effective sequences, \"Smile\" is ultimately banal. More than anything else, its trite dialogue and lackluster performances drain the film of its creative potential. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about it though is that, even as a popcorn movie, it is inefficacious on nearly every level. 4/10.'],\n",

No spoilers, but I do have to mention the ending.I was worried about the film flaking on its core message and giving us just another jumpfest of a finale and while again there were jumps, it actually ended in quite a brave way. The script fully commits and embraces the core themes and ends on a devastatingly haunting note.I was very surprised and really did enjoy this film, despite some of its flaws. I especially enjoyed the films obvious inspiration from films such as the ring, insidious and saint maud. Three horror films I quite enjoy. And I also loved it\\'s core themes surrounding trauma and mental health instead of just being \"Spooky monster film\" while also managing to have a spooky monster too.'],\n",

You're watching the thirteenth installment of a simple and good film made 44 years ago. Michael Myers has become a blood-transmitted disease, and Halloween is now a self-meta pseudophilosophical parody nightmare.The time-space continuum was broken, and Haddonfield now exists in two temporal realities simultaneously - 1978 and 2019. People act like videogame NPCs, you press the interaction key, and they speak in random text lines or do random things.There are many scenes in this film, none of which are connected in any way but are very diverse in nature. There was some good gore, and funny parody sketches with actors almost laughing on set.The film almost drove me into an epileptic seizure 30 minutes in, but then Shaft showed up, and things got really cool.In all seriousness, it seems to me that the script was assembled from scraps of something else, most likely a gritty thriller set in the '70s setting. They took some scene ideas and just slapped them over the tired Halloween routine.There is one more possibility, though. They probably wanted to pull off a Matrix sequel, making it bad and saying it was made that way deliberately. But this only works once, and they already did it with The Matrix Resurrections.

But I have to say that I didn\\'t really care much about the characters in the movie, as the narrative was not entertaining to me, and the character gallery was just a bit too mundane.I wasn\\'t impressed with this movie, and I think it is actually one of the worst additions to the \"Halloween\" franchise.My rating of \"Halloween Ends\" lands on a three out of ten stars.'],\n",

       "  'Defying all logic, I have a soft spot for the Halloween series. Perhaps because The very first Halloween was the second real horror film I ever saw, and made little kid me afraid of the dark for a good few weeks. It left a lasting impression. I saw them out of order, 4,6,5,7,3,2,8. I can\\'t remember where I put my keys yesterday, but I remember the order in which I watched the Halloween series. While that is indeed ridiculous, part of the reason was that Part 2 was banned in my country and I had to jump through some hoops to watch it. Back then tracking down uncut horror movies was an art in itself.But enough rambling about yesteryear, all I wanted to say is that I very much enjoy the series and wanted to like this. Halloween 2018 started the new series off promisingly. The first hour in particular was tense and gruesome. They managed to establish logical places for the characters to be in, and the two reporters were interesting new characters - until they died and the far less interesting Strode family became the protagonists for the remaining 40 minutes of the film. Therein lies a fundamental flaw of the sequel trilogy. The Strodes are boring. While Jamie Lee Curtis was able to inject some life into crazy lady Laurie in 2018, Karen and Allison are more or less just there without much to do. They just as well could have been one character.In this movie, one again the new character is the most interesting. Corey\\'s story is actually engaging. Yes, the romance was poorly handled, but as a character we feel for him. At least initially, until the stupid stuff with Michael Myers happens.The first 30 minutes of Halloween Ends offers more character development than Halloween Kills in its entire run time.Where this Ends falls into the same trap though, is pretentiousness masquerading as substance. Since Kills, they are pretending that their slasher movies are some profound musings on the nature of evil or the trauma, when really they didn\\'t.In Ends, yet again, they try to add subtext and philosophy into a story that starts off as a character drama. The ending in particular is one of the worst instances of pretentious film school style pseudo-intellectualism I have ever seen. I kept thinking of Neil Breen - if you know who that is, you know what means. If not, look him up.The filmmakers tried to be clever and adding some allegory about trauma spreading from person to person (not how trauma works) before leading into a pretentious setup for yet another sequel. \"Evil doesn\\'t die, it just changes shape.\" Someone in the movie theatre called out \"Life finds a way\" and everone laughed. This was certainly not the filmmakers desired reaction for their profound horror soliloquy.Halloween Ends contorts its narrative logic until it collapses under its own pretentions. The original movie worked, because it was a master class in film making. Starting with wide shots, giving us a feeling of the town more so than any exposition dump in the new movies. The presence of the killer always felt, rarely seen, paranoia slowly creeping up as night fell, with the camera angles getting closer, the scenery more claustrophibic and frightening and the darkness eventually encompassing everything.The new ones are way too convoluted from a narrative and thematic standpoint for their own good.There are a few things to like here. As said, the first half hour is strong, mostly carried by Rohan Campbell\\'s acting. He carries the film. A very promising actor.The use of music is very good and the remixed versions of the original still add tension and class.They got the look of the mask right, there are a few adequately bloody kills and the color grading and cinematography are good.I didn\\'t mind the fact that they moves away fromt he formula or that Michael\\'s role was so reduced. He\\'s been overused more than Darth Vader at this point. Halloween was on the right track with Halloween 3 Season of the Witch. They should have continued with that kind of anthology concept of a Halloween themed horror film every few years. Here\\'s hoping the next inevitable reboot will do just that.'],\n",

       "  \"Greetings again from the darkness. Don't look away. Whether referring to Mamie Till-Mobley telling family members to look at the disfigured boy in the casket, or to the general counsel to all citizens in this day of division, the sentiment is the same ... see with your own eyes so that you understand the injustice. Writer-director Chinonye Chukwu (CLEMENCY, 2019) and her co-writers Michael Reilly and Keith Beauchamp allow us to see the tragic story of Emmett Till through the eyes of his mother, and it's a powerful approach. It's Mr. Beauchamp who has diligently researched this story for almost 25 years, and was the driving force behind the 2005 documentary, THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL.The film certainly benefits from the powerhouse performance of Danielle Deadwyler (THE HARDER THEY FALL, 2021) as Mamie Till-Mobley. Mamie's love and concern for her 14-year-old son Emmett (a terrific Jalyn Hall) is only surpassed by her strength and dignity after his death ... and all of this is masterfully portrayed by Ms. Deadwyler in her surefire Oscar contending role. We see just enough of young Emmett to realize he's a well-raised, considerate, and fun-loving boy who sometimes stutters. He's so excited for his trip from Chicago to Mississippi to meet some of his relatives, while seeing and doing new things. It's 1955, and Mamie tries to caution Emmett on the differences between their world at home and the southern world he's about to enter.There are varying accounts of what Emmett actually did or didn't do to Money, Mississippi store clerk Carolyn Bryant (played by Haley Bennett, SWALLOW, 2019), but the shock of seeing Emmett's disfigured face and body is handled brilliantly here, and though the actual violence occurs off screen, the impact remains. Against all of her motherly protective instincts, Mamie seizes the power of the moment to have a photograph taken and demand an open casket so that the world can witness the result of the atrocity. Her ability to think clearly catapulted the case to national attention, and allowed Emmett Till to become a name and example that is still studied today.The supporting cast includes Frankie Faison (Mamie's father), Whoopi Goldberg (Mamie's mother), Sean Patrick Thomas, Tosin Cole (as Medgar Evers), John Douglas Thompson, and Jayme Lawson. The trial of the men accused of beating and killing Emmett plays a part here, but the only real courtroom drama occurs when Mamie takes the stand. It's in that moment when Ms. Deadwyler truly shines and allows us to feel a mother's pain and disgust. Afterwards, we get a taste of her activism ... something she continued until her death in 2003 at age 81. Filmmaker Chukwu benefits from the performance of Deadwyler and the years of research by Mr. Beauchamp, and she delivers a film that allows us to experience a dark moment in history from a different perspective - the eyes of a mother.Opens in theaters on October 21, 2022.\"],\n",

Nor would any parent ever want to deal with so much pain.While the movie takes certain liberties-it's still a movie, the story behind the real life event stayed true.I found the movie hard to watch at times being a father and biracial myself along with biracial children. The story comes down to a mother's simple quest for justice in the murder of her son. To those not familiar with Emmit Till's story, I urge you to look it up for yourself.Danielle Deadwyler plays Till's mother and she gives a knockout performance rivaling anyone who's won an academy award.

This docudrama not only does justice to the tragedy, but it also shows the death\\'s influence on the 1967 Civil Rights Act.Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler in a sure-to-be-Oscar nominated performance) fights to have her son\\'s brutalized body shown to the public, and it was shown, and like the movie itself, unforgettable. The film shoots this struggle in bright color as if to proclaim the horror vividly to the world. While strong black men recoiled from facing down white supremacists, Mamie never backed down in her attempt to bring justice for her son and expose the bigotry that exists even today.While sometimes the music is heavy-handed and the courtroom drama veers to conventionality, never does the script waver from an even-keeled tempo, that like the Civil Rights Movement itself edges inexorably to success, the only possible outcome when justice is on its side. Although the material may be too emotionally sensitive for some, most will appreciate the unsentimental, unsensational, respectful delivery.Emmett\\'s famously bloated and disfigured face haunted us almost 70 years ago from the pages of Jet magazine, and it is no less disturbing now in Till.

       "  \"Though certainly not a perfectly crafted film, Till is stuffed with powerhouse performances and scenes that I couldn't take my eyes off of.Danielle Deadwyler gives potentially the most engrossing, beautifully heart-wrenching performance I have beheld this year. She disappears into the role and becomes the grieving mother who was Mamie Till. She channels all of the proper emotions at all of the proper times. Sorrow, regret, compassion, hope-all of them and more are tangible in this woman as we follow her journey.What elevates the emotional core of the story even more is the impressive directing. There are impressively long takes and varied shot composition that always appear meticulously planned and crafted for the purpose of highlighting the actors and allowing them to shine, as they all deliver their dialogue with incredible sympathetic power.I usually don't rant and rave about musical scores, as I find most of them just serviceable. This one deserves recognition. The music is used surprisingly sparingly, never drowning out the human interactions. But when it's heard, it instils both melancholy and hope into the film, which is exactly what the story is ultimately about.But, like just about every biopic, Till has its issues, though the ones found here are relatively minor.For one thing, though the long takes are impressive and allow emotions to linger, they're often too long. A great deal of shots linger way longer than they need to, and scenes carry on beyond the time that their point was made. It hurts the pacing considerably.And while I did admire the script's attempt to include a great deal of real-life characters and plot points for the sake of integrity and uncomfortable honesty, it also hurts the pacing, as quite a few of them inevitably need to be rushed through with little-to-no impact on the larger picture. This is almost always a problem with biopics, which is why I think most of them should have been TV miniseries instead.Till has a great deal more depth and care put into it than I was expecting, and I applaud its ambitious reach, as it does grasp the vast majority of what it reaches for.\"],\n",

Maybe the fact that this was a true story makes it hold more weight because I wasn't really moved by the movie itself, gives it emotional value as it's very important in American black history.Only problem is the story went how I thought it would, so it just feels like one that you've already heard before. If you're already invested in the what the movie has to tell beforehand, then you might appreciate it more. I thought it would be something new and intriguing, instead it's different characters and setting but same stories and similar ones have already been told better(sad reality that they're commonplace).It carries an important message, just unfortunate it wasn't told as best as it could've been. It just leans so much on the pain the mother and story carries in order to move you. It's not half bad, it's just a movie that needs you to already believe in the message to elevate it from just a decent movie into an astonishing one.

       "  \"Historically, when the name 'Till' is cited, it generally refers only to Emmett, the 14 year old boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955. Chinonye Chukwu's TILL seeks to have audiences also respect the memory of Emmett's proud mother, Mame Till-Mobley.In many ways, TILL is a fairly straightforward Bio-pic. Chukwu's script (with a pair of co-writers) carefully traces the days leading up to Emmett's (Jalyn Hall) fateful trip from his native Chicago down to Mississippi to visit his cousins. Mame (Danielle Deadwyler) knows the dangers and does her best to warn the teen. As history shows, a tragedy worse than his mother could have possibly imagined occurs when a white woman, Carolyn (Haley Bennett), accuses young Emmett of impropriety. After Emmett''s murder, Mame bravely travels to Mississippi to confront her son's accusers and testify on his behalf.The film is quite accurate to the events, even if some of the screenplay falls into familiar Bio-pic traps - a certain overly prettified period look, an overblown score and preachy dialogue that speaks from the present day rather than to what was happening then and there. What keeps the movie on track are the performances. Hall is bright and ebullient, Mame's family are strong (including Whoopi Goldberg, who also co-produced the movie) and the other supporting players are equally adept. Still, it's Deadwyler, who is exceptional here. Much of the role requires a certain internal fortitude rather than big showy emotional moments, but Deadwyler is forceful even in the quietest scenes.The dramatic climax happens even before the trial - Emmett's body is brought back to Chicago for Mame to identify. There is shock and horror, of course, but, Deadwyler also conveys the deep love she had for her son. A mother's love that even death cannot shake. Mame's resolve for the whole world to see the horrors of what happened to her child reverberates to this day. TILL may be a bit conventional, but, Deadwyler's performance and the history that Chukwu highlights give it power.\"],\n",

This fact-based offering vividly depicts the brutality and injustice of what happened (faint of heart viewers be warned) while simultaneously chronicling the efforts of Till\\'s courageous mother, Mamie, to protect and champion the civil rights of minorities. As one of the seminal moments in the struggle to protect those who were most vulnerable at a time when many in society were content to otherwise look the other way, this release shows how a fiercely loving and devoted mother forced the complacent to see what was really happening - and creating a grass roots groundswell for change in the process. The film gets just about everything right (save for a musical score that doesn\\'t quite seem to align with the subject matter), including in the superb period piece production values, writing that fittingly captures the mood and themes of this story, and, most notably, the performances, particularly those of Oscar contender Danielle Deadwyler, Jalyn Hall, Whoopi Goldberg and other cast members.

       "  '\"TILL\" was powerfully and extraordinarily done in terms of actors, accuracy, and such. The movie captures reasonably accurately and precisely what occurred, and does an honorable job of capturing and conveyed this horrific episode in history. What happened to Emmitt Till in 1955 in Mississippi has haunted me for years and years... It was and is very important to make this very well known to persons across the country and the world, including in the form of this greatly-done movie. (There were a couple of detailed things I had not known, such as the touching fact that Emmett gave his Mom his wrist-watch before getting on the train.)As careful research of facts has revealed, the initial horror is then added to by that cashier-female person\\'s total manufacturing of lies about what Emmitt really did and said in the store. What we do know is that he \\'whistled\\' at her outside the store. Maybe while alive that shop-girl person will publicly tell the truth about what Did and what Did Not happen. She owes that to the family, the nation, and the world at large.And then the so-called \"jury\" renders a not-guilty verdict. Horror is added to horrors again and again over time as the murderers openly admit their crimes AND GET PAID FOR DOING SO!Some of the other offenses are left out in interest of time and pacing, such as how, after Emmitt\\'s brutal torture and murder, Emmitt\\'s Dad\\'s military record was grossly misrepresented by the southern Caucasian crowd in order to undermine what was done to Emmitt Till.The way African Americans were (to some extent still are?) referred to and regarded in \"Mississippi,\" and how such courageous and gracious people are referred to with name-calling and such was and is stingingly horrific. -- in 1955 it was, and still is done by small tiny-minded persons who were bred, fed, and indoctrinator in these prejudiced ways and mind-sets. (This poisonous \\'treatment of\\' and name-calling of Black fellow human beings is part of the reason for 9 stars instead of 10, even though it was historically accurate -- I just couldn\\'t stand it or abide it.)One of the most profound and powerful statements in the whole film was the quote of what Emmitt Till\\'s Mom so aptly said: \"WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ANY OF US, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, HAD BETTER BE THE BUSINESS OF US ALL.\" - Emmett Till\\'s Mother, Mamie - her revelation after the incident and trial.'],\n",

       "  \"LIKES:Fantastic Setting: If we are going back to the past, then you have to make it look like the past. This was accomplished very well with Till and helping us roll back to a part of the 1950s where so many worlds existed. We might not be in the parts that made our toes tap, our boys coming home, and sitcoms that kept us rolling in our seats. However, the movie does put us into the cultural life of a very active time and with it immerses us into the tale we are about to see. That visualization is a very important part to so much of the movie and they accomplished it beautifully with the vehicles, outfits, and buildings that they restored. Powerful stuff there.Great Use of Music/Sound Editing: Again, visual moments are a part of movies today, but the sound can be just a powerful storyteller as the visual moments they serve. Till has so much audio work to help amplify the emotions of the scene, choosing both scores and effects to add to sell the heart breaking emotion of the movie. The orchestral works play in the background to help add ambience, those gradual changes to tone constantly playing at different levels to fill the silence. Meanwhile, the musical tracks are there to bring the culture to life, but also help add some lyrics to the moment that seem to do better than the actual dialogue itself. That balance helps a lot of things sort of even out and not become a massively overwhelming movie of depression.Really Good Pace: I can't say it's perfect, but for a biopic, Till surprised me by how little I had to look at the phone to assess the time lapse. Biopics are often a bit bland and uneven at times, but this self-contained story had great direction to tell so much in such a little time. The set up was greatly done to give adequate details without dragging it out, the climactic moments had enough finesse to really make them shine, and the supporting elements all came together to be quite awesome in the long run. This part to me was perhaps one of the biggest surprises of the movie in just how well it moved.Avenues of History Building With The Main Story: Like I said above, the movie did a lot in a shorter amount of time. I felt they accomplished this balancing by helping to tag on the key moments that were building in these times, like the development of unions, the NAACP rising, and the rights they were fighting for and using them to help build this tale into. By using the moments and resorting to dialogue telling the tale, I really found that the movie managed to tell so many tales of the historical times and never swallow the story of the Tills during the segregated times of the 1950s. When you can do that and tell history through one event, using it as a lynchpin that binds it all together into a tree sitting in a forest, that's when you impress me with telling the political tale.Censorship is Just Right: This movie is going to be hard for many to watch, but fear not, there was very tasteful displays done for this movie. Till does not get lost in the domestic violence displays that drama movies have thrived on for years. No, instead they give you enough context, set up, and dialogue to paint the picture, with only a few moments of very contained shots to bring the point to life. Sure, there are going to be some moments that will still make people sick, angry, or emotional, but to handle such a tale like the Tills in such a classy way that did not dilute the impact of the movie is something I must once again nod my hat towards for great storytelling.The Acting: One of the strongest pieces of this movie is the acting and just how realistic I found the performances to be. I'll go ahead and say there is some stereotyping and extreme moments you probably expect, but it's all kept well in check and paints the picture you need it to be. Faison is fine for the little he speaks, but the man has visual acting down pat and just needed more moments to fully bring his performance out in full. Hall did well for the role Emmett, though there was more character profiling needing to be done to help further expand the performance. Yet, his ability to play well with the other members of the family displayed great skills in the Thespian arts that I look forward to seeing in the future. The star is Deadwyler though, a woman who really took the Dramatic Historical genre and ran with it. She holds control of her vocal patterns quite well, and brought so much passion to the project that it was hard for me not to get entranced into the woman's words. That fire, the delivery of her dialogue, and that crying were so well used by her, that for once I was really moved by a crying scene instead of annoyed, at least most of the time. Regardless, I was quite pleased with what was accomplished by her and the chemistry of her acting to just about every single person in this role.The Emotional Motivation: Till is a movie that is going to cause a lot of fires to be stoked on the Internet. It's a very emotional movie that will land bullseye hits on things like sadness, rage, spirituality, and motivation for justice/change. The movie sometimes does preach a bit on these moments with in your face writing, but for the majority captures the essence of this case and what it did for the historical revolutions. This tragedy really opened the gates on so many things, and feeling the rush of emotions for each act really helped me enjoy this movie more, sometimes wanting to shout out my response like one of the other audience members did. That does not happen to me a lot, and I applaud so many people for making these moments click with an audience member like me.The Monologue: Perhaps my favorite part though is this great monologue near the end of the movie. That speech is this sledgehammer that breaks the ground open and busts open the majesty of the powerful words people can say. The timing of the moment was top game. The set up and integration into the scene, near flawless as it proved to be the key point in the argument. And the delivery, acting and nuances around it all come together to be one of those famous moments that will end up on top 10 lists on YouTube. By far my favorite part of the movie, and very much a summary of the entire film into one sequence, this is something I hope many other fans enjoy like I did.DISLIKES:\\nAt Times Felt Cut/Edited Funny: This dislike is a bit picky, but at times it felt like there was more to the story to tell as Mamie sought justice for the incident. Maybe there was more adventure to see in Mississippi, or perhaps there were more memories to draw on to help further deepen the relationship. Maybe there were more moments of interacting with other characters, or perhaps a little more the antagonists viewpoints that they wanted to explore. I don't know the answer, but things felt at times a bit more edited and lacking, which for the movie like this, I would have welcomed to get a little more of the picture of the Till story.Wanted More of the Case Preparation To Help Add that Movie Magic: When you start doing cases and building up evidence for a very hot topic like this one in the decades, I hope that movie magic comes into play to amp up the drama. Till takes a more realistic approach, or perhaps cutting the movie like they did gave that illusion. Either way, the movie could have used more case build up magic that I've seen in other Crime series/movies. I can't tell you how or what cliches they could have done, but I can say that little regulation of flavor might have upped the game a little more for me. When adding those moments in and giving you more of that suspense and strategy, you help make one of the biggest moments of the movie shine even greater. Yet at 2 hours and ten minutes, that could really have dragged things out.A Little More Other Character Involvement, primarily Whoopi: My biggest dislike, the character moments felt a little underutilized at times. Don't get me wrong, many characters did great, had purpose, and were memorable, but there are again things that feel a little cheated out in the grand design. There seemed to be more to the story of Mamie, with so many people helping her that I had expected much more engagement than what we got sometimes. This was true for the legendary Goldberg, who though did great with her limited dialogue, had more to give in the grand scheme of things. Had this been fleshed out more, we could certainly get a longer movie, and perhaps overshadow the emotion I talked about earlier. However, adding a little bit more at times would not have hurt if done as strategically as so many other movies have done.The VERDICT:Till is a powerhouse of emotional drama that utilizes so many things well to really make the tale come to life. The actors in this movie are certainly much of the thanks for bringing so much fire to this movie, dominating the screen with performances certainly worthy of awards. However, the writing, directing, and visual elements certainly have much to do with the experience being maximized to drive the emotion even further. Things come together very well in this movie, and I was very pleased with so much they balanced in the short amount of time they did it in. It was smart writing, with very big respect and that to me is tough to accomplish in this day and age. Certainly there are more things that could use time to polish out. Character development and cutting certainly are two of the bigger things to smooth out, and adding some movie magic to the court case would have been nice too. Yet, the movie makes these moments seem trivial, when you see the movie as a whole and I again enjoyed this film so well.My scores are:\\nDrama: 8.5-9.0\\nMovie Overall 8.0.\"],\n",

She is originally from Mississippi and believes it's important for her son to spend time with family and learn where he came from. She warns him things are different in the south before he goes but a few remarks to the wrong person after he gets there, and the boy ends up missing and eventually brutally murdered. The story follows how the mother manages the loss of her son and seeks justice....This movie is directed by Chinonye Chukwu (Clemency) and stars Danielle Deadwyler (The Harder they Fall), Frankie Faison (Coming to America), Whoopi Goldberg (Sister Act), Haley Bennett (Swallow) and Jalyn Hall (Space Jam: A New Legacy).The depiction of the settings and era was perfect. The attire Deadwyler wore the entire picture was stunning as was the cinematography and use of lighting. The performances are very strong across the cast. The storyline really focuses on the main character and how a mother has to deal with these types of incidents and manage them both on a micro and macro level. It was impressive how the story follows her journey. The premise of the storyline didn't add much new outside of those elements; however, the delivery of the strengths of Mamie was impressive. Her interactions with every character were interesting, unpredictable and worthwhile. You didn't know if she was going to be mad, sad, breakdown or composed.Overall, this is a solid period piece with a worthwhile storyline about the legendary Mamie Till-Mobley. I would score this a solid 8/10 and strongly recommend it.\"],\n",

       "  \"I had been fascinated by the Emmett Till story having watched several documentaries so I was excited when this movie was announced.In a movie year where there was up to this point one film I found truly exceptional which was Top Gun Maverick, I was concerned that with the track record of bad films this movie may not serve its story justice.While Maverick may be the most entertaining movie I have seen this year so far, artistically Till is the best film. The Academy must recognize all involved at Oscar time. Danielle Dayweather must get Best Actress and the movie needs to be nominated for Best Picture. Yes it's that good.As some other reviews have stated this is a straightforward biopic. Naturally if you know the real story everything will be predictable.But that doesnt matter because the story is told so magnificently with great writing, direction, superb acting and set design.I have a feeling this may not light fire at the box office which is a shame because this movie represents a very important part of history. Even with a PG-13 rating it is a fairly intense film, but this was also a very intense part of history.Some audiences may find it too unsettling and disturbing but it is supposed to be so, but we also can learn about how to stand up for those who need it and to pay attention more closely to issues in our nation that need attention and to do something about them.I dont want to say too much more and possibly give away more details but if you are thinking of seeing junk this fall season like Halloween Ends skip it and go see a truly great movie one that may not be equaled for some time.Congratulations to all involved in this wonderful film and let's hope you are all remembered at Oscar time.\"],\n",

The main theme of this movie should have been the overarching racism that was in Mississippi and the time, but this movie reminded me of a Hallmark movie; it almost shunned racism and soft pedaled what was happening in Mississippi in the 50s. The directing was awful; the story was awful; the actress who played Mamie did a great job with what she had to work with.What this movie needed was an angry Black man at the helm, not a young woman from Africa. I'm sure Spike Lee died if he watched this movie and is now rolling over in his grave.Please, Please, someone remake this movie with the anger and indignation that it calls for. Show us White people for the monsters we were (and many still are). Show the truth. Tell the whole story. Two White animals murdered this young boy. 12 White racists set them free.

       "  \"Likes:Cute: If you have seen the trailers, you want be surprised that this movie is adorable on so many levels. Lyle's journey starts out very charming, the cute little baby croc being like a child version of the Geico Gecko, and then quickly blooming into that tragic and loveable hero. The movie feels much like a kids' book come to life and both live and animate characters being these loveable representations of family values. The antics are fun, the lighthearted nature of the movie just puts a loveable quality to it, and the positivity takes away just about every scary element of the world. All in all it's fun.Decent Pace For First Part of the Film: The pacing of the film works so well for me at the start. It's not a prolonged banter and trek through the muck of how rough life can be. No, Lyle gets right into the theatrics, having fun and getting the good vibes started as the animate crocodile and his new friend start their journey to a new life. Sure it takes some of the sting and character development out, but in doing so, it respects the time and fun to give you and your kids the wow factor they want.The Acting: It's not bad at all for me in this film. Lyle's cast is impressive, and though they are in a children film, the performances aren't pulled like some other younger films do. Constance Wu is the best for me in this film, a bit kid focused, but then recovering to be the same fiery spirit that the woman always brings, balanced with the care she shows too. A toned down version of Crazy Rich Asians to give you an example. Then comes Javier Bardem, the man is fun and certainly in a place I have not seen, but gives the role enthusiasm, splendor, and more details despite not being his usual element. Scoot McNairy is fine as Mr. Primm, and once the movie actually starts picking things up, the character gets better than when he first starts, more interesting and dynamic when he starts integrating with the rest of the family. Special shout out to Winslow Fegley because the star of the show with Lyle deserves recognition for the stellar performance he put on as the kid struggling to find friends and seek out kindness. The chemistry around the team is very good, and they form that odd family they were going for in this film.The Humor: Certainly geared to a much younger audience, Lyle is golden for the fun and lighthearted jokes that I think you could expect this movie to have. I chuckled a lot at the timing of many jokes, especially involving the cat, as they worked with the real life cast. Sure, this is going to be much more tuned to the 4-11 year old range if I'm honest, but the humor is very fitting for the film without being so juvenile that adults will be bored to death. That's a plus in my book.The Heart and Soul Of the Movie: Beneath all the fun though is the heart and soul of what the movie wants. Lyle's books may be a tribute to Nick Jr. Like tales, but the movie was adapted to be something more and it really worked for me in the grand scheme of things. Lyle's movie has about three big lessons to take away from in my book, but they all work organically, and are presented well for much of the film. There is character development with inspirational shots and moments, and they don't go too preachy for much of the film given what they could have done instead. As the film continues to expand further, and the plot progresses, the film had my heart as the final numbers happened. I found some relevance which helps, but overall the movie has a lot of soul and quality that I absolutely love in my films.The Musical Numbers: By far, the biggest bang of the movie are the song and dance numbers. Like a kid version of the Greatest Showman, Lyle has props for the song department. Covers are fun and tuned to the scene, giving Mendes his chance to really make his move on some classic songs that are fun. However, the original numbers and songs, though repetitive, really have that fire I like and give you the spirit of the show business, without the circus as a medium. They were creative with the numbers, the energy exciting and fun, with some creativity to the stage they performed in. I see many a child enjoying this, and theater loving child at heart enjoying it even more. Mendes carries a lot of weight on his shoulder, and the pop nature of the movie really drives the bus to the magical art of the theater. I think this will be a big winner for the movie and certainly worth a trip to theater.DISLIKES:The Plot has Holes: One of my biggest things I did not like, was the gaping holes and shortcuts of the movie. Lyles journey has a lot of heart, and cuteness, but the movie takes major leaps in the timeline with the story which was glaringly obvious for me. I cringed at how fast things progressed, and how so many other character arcs were sort of smoothed over to fit another song into the mix. Don't get me wrong, your kids won't care and the movie is still fun, but there was more that could have been done to make the story much more integrated and natural to make the full tale come to life.Misuse of Characters: There are two or three characters in the film who had props to be another part of the story. Perhaps it's going to be in a sequel, but these characters are the story arcs that feel very misused and skipped on when it came to the tale. The African American girl in particularly held a lot of props, but she was directed towards some key moments that left me feeling cheated of another fun element and interactions. Again, when you see the big animate crocodile and the fun he is having, most are not going to care, but as a reviewer there was much more for the film to give if they had just taken time and maybe one less reprise of the first song.The Ending Is a Bit Rushed: A lot of things happen in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, and though you get plenty of details for the experience, I can't say that the movie accomplished the best conclusion to the tale. Lyle's journey needed a little more organization, a little more flair and planning, a little more edge in the kid fashion, and of course more time. So many things felt too convenient and jammed in, that the last ten minutes or so felt like an afterthought that put a nice bow on the movie. Will it accomplish the task at hand? Sure, it almost always does and paves the way for something more to come. However, the movie needs a bit more polish to reach the full potential for the ending.The Animation At Times: Again, the studio can do a lot more than I can with their talent and resources, and I really did find the animation adorable and moving with ease. However, the movie is pulling some punches compared to other feats of CGI technology and does not quite look as real as some might want it to. The cat named Loretta is a prime example of this, looking a tad too CGI, and Lyle at times gets a bit too cartoony given again what other films have done. The worst is when other crocodiles show up. They are consistent, but you tend to notice the limitations when they are trying to make the other animals have a more realistic touch. It's nitpicky I know, and truth be told, the style holds a bit of the spirt and fun of the movie with it, but that doesn't meant eh animation is not something that can get touched up on.The VERDICT:To be honest, I had a lot of fun with the movie and found the crocodile's story to be one fo the most touching films of the year. Lyle and his crew will really drive into the hearts of the young and young at heart, and give you a cute adventure that feels out of a picture book. With some great relevance to me, the movie touches some great life lessons in a deep manner, and tends to shy away from the in your face moments, which is a plus for me. And of course the songs are fantastic in bringing life to the screen and really providing the break from reality this film is meant to do. True, the story needs work, the planning and time constraints really feeling present to me with several character and story arcs that were frustrating to witness. And ti's true that the movie needed some more timing components when it came to the ending. But I feel this movie is a great night out at the theater, especially for a family fun night, or at least a view at home. With this, my scores for Lyle's adventure are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0\\nMovie Overall: 7.0.\"],\n",

Their effort shows and mostly pays off.As for plot, it's very narratively slight; it's full of contrivances and forced conflicts that never once felt substantial or surprising or meaningful.

       "  'Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is a fabulous musical film about overcoming your fears, to accept something new while pushing the traditional boundaries of what we call family.The storyline follows a boy, Josh (Winslow Fegley), moving to New York City with his parents and being uncomfortable with new challenges like an unfamiliar home, crowded New York City and meeting new friends at a new school. Josh is a kind soul, but he\\'s frequently afraid and lacks confidence. However he had no idea how much his life would change in a matter of days after his family\\'s move to the new city.This movie is funny; the music is contagious; and the love and care of one another is beautiful. The special effects and scenes of the film are incredible! What I love about the film is how Lyle the Crocodile (Shawn Mendes), with his special talent changes the lives of the main characters in the film. It starts with Hector (Javier Barden), a struggling showman who never gives up on Lyle\\'s talent or his own and, after some bumps, learns the importance of friendship and family. Josh and Lyle become friends in a very awkward way and from then on never want to be separated from each other. Josh\\'s Mom (Constance Wu) and Dad (Scoot McNairy) can\\'t believe their eyes when they see Lyle for the first time, and their hearts open wide for the big creature. My favorite scene is when Josh and Lyle sing, without any fear, to the whole city. The trust between them is honest and cute. As in almost every film, a bad guy (and his pet) are around. In this case, Mr. Grumps (Brett Gelman) - a very not fun and unhappy neighbor and his cat, Loretta, who almost destroy the show of a lifetime and a beautiful family. You must see it!The message of Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is \"Trust and believe your family and closest friends; they are always looking out for you and your success.\"I give Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults.

And that absence is felt, with multiple moments begging the question \"wonderful characters, but what is this all about ultimately?\".The pacing was a little off, with really exciting moments followed by long, trudging luls. While everyone was so very incredibly charming, the movie did feel boring at times.Finally, the missed opportunity is the songs. They\\'re simply not iconic. I still remember songs from Frozen, Moana, Encanto and others, but I\\'m confident that I won\\'t remember any of the tunes from Lyle.This may not read like a particularly flattering review and that\\'s not my intention.

Each song adds depth to the story and elevates the otherwise slow-paced script.The casting is excellent with Shawn Mendes stealing the show. His voice is incredible and hilariously fits the adolescent crocodile. My kids were itching to dance the whole time and energetically cheered Lyle on.

Is this a negative? Not at all, there are plenty of children\\'s movies that have excellent cinematic value. Although it is cute, \"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile\" is not one of those movies. The film is full of cliches, the characters act more like caricatures than real people and the story is paper thin.There are four new songs by Pasek and Paul in this movie, and that is not enough. All four songs are going to be on repeat in my car for weeks, but I wish there were more (for context, \"The Greatest Showman\" had 9 original songs). While the music is great, the plot in between songs was rudimentary and a little awkward.\"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile\" is exactly what you would expect after looking at the poster.

On a visit to a pet shop one day, he encounters the eponymous character whom he discovers can hold a tune. Ah, thinks he - a fortune to be made. He puts just about everything he has on the line but poor old \"Lyle\" has stage fright... won\\'t sing! Ruin befalls our entertainer so he leaves his home in the hands of the \"Primm\" family. Not long after they move in, the son \"Josh\" (a creditable effort from Winslow Fegley) hears noises in the attic and off we go on the more standard series of escapades peppered with some tunes and hysterical antics from his slightly surprised parents, an intervention from the city authorities and a gently pleasing conclusion that does elicit just the merest hint of a tear. Shawn Mendez (\"Lyle\") has one of those voices that I find instantly forgettable, and the pens of \"Dear Evan Hansen\" creators Benj Pasek and Justin Paul really don\\'t bombard us with much to get the toes tapping aside from, perhaps, \"Top of the World\". The storyline reminded me a lot of \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" (2021) - child and curious pet deal with fun adventures and mishaps - and as a gently entertaining piece of drama this does fine. It\\'s just not a film that I think I will remember watching.'],\n",

       "  'On Monday 29th August (a bank holiday in England), the Cineworld at Leicester Square, London was completely packed for this film. They\\'d turned the air-conditioning on a bit too high, which gave the film an extra edge.This film is very gorey. The screening today was Fright Fest (a festival for horror films), so we all loved it. I would definitely not take anyone squeamish to see this. Art the Clown has a particular thing for harming eyes, probably because he knows that we\\'re particularly squeamish about them. He also plays around with the brains and hearts of his victims. He often kills people just because they\\'re there, even if they\\'ve not done anything to offend him.A common criticism of the first film was that the plot was typical of the slasher genre, with teenage girls in trouble and the goody-two-shoes being the Final Girl. The plot is much better this time. I can tell you what each of the characters was doing with their time, before Art turned up, and there was a good thread on the father of Serena and Jonathan. Knowing that they\\'ve lost their father makes you feel sorry for them and want them to succeed. In the first film, part of me thought that it\\'d be funny for Art the Clown to win, but I really wanted to see him get vanquished in this one.I have some reservations. It is too long, being about an hour longer than the first film. The supernatural element is also a bit muddled. In \"All Hallows\\' Eve\", Art was clearly supernatural. In \"Terrifier\", you could just about believe that he was human, except for right at the end. In this one, there are supernatural things throughout, but there\\'s never any rules established. I know that film-makers like to keep audiences guessing, but the guessing game is more fun if we have clues to go on. The magic in \"Terrifier 2\" feels a bit too random to make you wonder what\\'s supposed to be happening.Still 8/10 for the pure horror, despite those reservations.'],\n",

       "  'With practically double the runtime of the original film, Damien Leone\\'s \"Terrifier 2\" sets out to be a more lengthy, ambitious, and terrifying movie than \"Terrifier,\" the film that started it all through the memorable introduction of a new horror icon in Art The Clown. And while the first movie wasn\\'t the most creative, with a light on story and high on violence approach that never differentiated itself any further from your ordinary uber-gory slasher, the character of Art managed to capture the attention and imagination of viewers and critics alike. The silent, but incredibly animated and expressive, mime proved to be a beloved villain through the juxtaposition of his quiet demeanor but loud actions - as they put so succinctly in this film, \"For a guy who doesn\\'t speak, he sure makes a lot of noise.\" Art\\'s shenanigans continue in full force here, giving audiences more of what they expect, but maybe not exactly in the way they expected - \"Terrifier 2\" improves upon its predecessor through its more complex plot, especially as told through its character development of Lauren LaVera\\'s character, Sienna.A two hour and 18 minute run time is nothing to sneeze at, and director Damien Leone knows this - so he wastes no time in introducing the carnage that audiences expect from Art. Opening with a bloody bang, the film engages immediately, giving viewers just a taste of the madness that is to come. But where the first \"Terrifier\" keeps its momentum through a cat and mouse style rampage that features Art mutilating and murdering everyone in his path, \"Terrifier 2\" slows things down after its explosive start. With an actual plot this time around, contrasting against the original\\'s more proof of concept style, \"Terrifier 2\" takes its time to build plot development through elongated dream sequences and true to life conversations, especially when it comes to the character of Sienna.\"Terrifier 2\\'s\" final girl, Sienna finds herself face to face with evil itself in the form of a psychotic clown. And you\\'d think that a basically all good, morally upright character would be a distraction from the film, but her good nature personality actually enhances the goings on, as she is a lawful good protagonist to contrast against Art\\'s chaotic evil. Lauren LaVera was incredible in the role as a fierce heroine who can certainly stand her own against a formidable opponent - I can see her compared to characters such as Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode, and her showdown with Art was endlessly entertaining and narratively satisfying. But alas! If you\\'re watching \"Terrifier 2,\" you\\'re watching it for the over the top violence and gore - so let\\'s talk about it.When it comes to slasher film blood and guts, \"Terrifier 2\" is the real deal - I can\\'t remember the last time I saw a movie this violent in theatres. Art rips people\\'s eyes out, chops people\\'s heads off, flays people alive, and scalps people, just to name a few things; if you are at all squeamish, you should not see this movie. However, if you enjoyed the first one for all of its darkly comedic brutality, you will certainly enjoy the upped ante here. All of the violence is disgusting and hard to watch, but it\\'s all being done by a highly animated and over-exaggerated clown, which makes even the most horrific crimes bizarrely entertaining. You\\'ll find yourself having a sort of sick smile on your face as Art makes his mark, and while you might feel yourself feeling guilty, you can\\'t help but think that the movie is relishing in its carnage as much as you are.\"Terrifier 2\" is a fun movie - it\\'s by no means high art, and I don\\'t think it is a classic by any means, but Art is certainly a horror icon and watching him in action literally never gets old. While more ambitious than the original, the plot still lacks real narrative heft besides, \"There\\'s an evil clown, and someone has to stop him.\" That said, the simplicity really does give way to some incredible horror set pieces that I will have burned into my memory for a long time. If you\\'re a fan of the first film, or even if you\\'re not and you are simply a fan of horror, you have to give this one a watch.'],\n",

As well as all of this they have a female lead that is acted well, written well, and delivers enough punch to make the audience root for her. Really well done guys. Good Job with this one.I'd watched Halloween Kills a few days ago, what an utter disappointment that was, this perked me up a little because it showed that creators are still out there that are willing to give the audience what they want. This is certainly a little more supernatural than the previous rendition, but that's fine by me as it's carried off with just enough cheese to make it what it should be.

       "  'The trailer for \"The Woman King\" would have you believe that the film is one constant, nonstop action romp. Alas, you have been misled! But what else are Hollywood marketing departments for than to trick potential viewers. More of a talky drama and less of an action extravaganza, \"The Woman King\" tells a revisionist, alternative history of the fierce Dahomey kingdom. I am no historian, so, when walking into this movie, I knew literally zero of whatever the true story may be; instead, I simply desired a film with an engaging plot, and well-shot action sequences. \"The Woman King\" has none of those to offer.For a film that advertises the brutality of its characters, \"The Woman King\" is surprisingly bloodless. With action scenes filmed in the typical close-up shaky camera style, this movie, in terms of its action, offers up nothing that you haven\\'t already seen before, and seen done better. During large-scale battles the camera shakes, as if the cameraman himself is having a seizure; the violence is censored and neutered, with a lot of the kills occurring offscreen - because a movie about slavery just has to be dumbed down to PG-13 to become family friendly! Film is a business, after all.Luckily, you will find some entertainment value - or at least I did - when viewing the culture of the Dahomey tribe. I can\\'t speak to the historical accuracy of what the film portrayed, but I do enjoy movies that show in such detail the culture of people who lived long ago, so I certainly enjoyed the various traditions and rituals that were shown on screen. Alas, I do have a complaint when it comes to this, though: What I thought would be my favorite part of the film, the military training, almost seemed like an afterthought with it taking up only a small amount of screen time. What, then, did the film focus on? Mediocre melodrama.With actresses that act so well you wonder if they were preordained for success in the film industry, \"The Woman King\" boasts Viola Davis and Lashana Lynch, two women who consistently give powerhouse performances. And while their performances are well done in this movie, the problem lies in the fact that \"The Woman King\" has a weak script. Instead of telling a straightforward story about fighting back against slavers, for some reason the movie decides to add plot threads (including an underwritten and unbelievable romance) that I, frankly, didn\\'t care about. So while I enjoyed the acting, I couldn\\'t help but feel taken out of and bored with the movie since the storylines never really grabbed me - a lot of it felt like it was taken out of a comic book or graphic novel, complete with a revenge subplot that was borderline unnecessary in a movie that was already about seeking revenge against those who have enslaved them.A crowd pleaser through and through, \"The Woman King\" is receiving both critical and general audience acclaim; with an A+ rating on Cinemascore, I\\'m sure that most will walk into and enjoy it for the historical epic that it is. However, the bloated plot, weak script, and worst of all, the watered down, unfulfilling, and incomprehensible action kept me from fully finding entertainment value in this movie because, as I often say, when the action in your action movie sucks, your movie sucks. And while \"The Woman King\" doesn\\'t suck, it\\'s not nearly as good as it would have you believe.'],\n",

I watched the movie today at the cinema and I was left with a slight feeling of disappointment.First off, the story is engaging and the the plot progression isn't bad. But something just felt missing.The trailer is a bit misleading but I won't spoil anything here.Let me start with the bad; the title gives the impression that Viola Davis is the central character but this is not so from what I saw, not really.Thuso Mbedu's character seems to be the protagonist here and her delivery is nothing short of amazing.Lashana Lynch is equally phenomenal as a supporting character, even outshining Davis.As for John Boyega, his outing as the young king is one or the best things about this film. I didn't know the actor had such charisma.Generally, the acting is good, especially from the aforementioned actors.Nigerian born actor Jimmy Odukoya is a great villain who wasn't given enough screentime.I believe the character would have been phenomenal if his backstory had been explored.The cinematography is below par (I have seen Nollywood movies with better camera work) but perhaps the biggest letdown is the action.The fight sequences came off as really disappointing as it was easy to see that it wasn't real combat despite the impressive choreography.The romance was forced and written in such a way that at the end of it all, I asked myself why it was there in the first place.The musical score is sublime and the songs and chants got my attention.At the risk of being bashed, I will end my review by saying The Woman King is a good movie that should have and could have been far more.\"],\n",

The storyline follows an African kingdom with a new(er) king in 1823 who posses the only female army in Africa. The leader of the female Army has a past that haunts her but the respect of her king, enough to be on his council. She strongly urges him to avoid the slave trade and find alternative methods of riches. Meanwhile, those who do believe strongly in the slave trade look to march on the kingdom and bring them down. A new recruitment class to the female army brings brashness, new ideas to defend the kingdom, and the female leader's ghosts back to the forefront...This movie is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball) and stars Viola Davis (The Help), Thuso Mbedu (The Underground Railroad), Lashana Lynch (No Time to Die), Sheila Atim (Doctor Strange: In the Mouth of Madness), John Boyega (Star Wars: Episode VII-IV) and Jimmy Odukoya (Mamba's Diamond).This movie has so much depth and contains a great primary plot and even better sub plots. The writing is remarkable, thorough and very impressive. The character's inner demons are well portrayed as is their struggle to overcome them. The acting is out of this world across the board. You feel for every character; and if anything happens to anyone, you feel personally hurt. The villains were also excellent as is the outcome of each of them. The settings and cinematography is outstanding and there is impressive use of lighting. The action scenes are remarkable and the fight choreography is award winning caliber. My only complaint is an awkward love story that is obviously in here to show maturity and self discovery but I could have done without it.Overall, this movie has literally everything you'd want in a movie - tremendous action, great villains, self discovery and character triumph. I would strongly, strongly recommend seeing this movie and score it a 10/10. We loved it.\"],\n",

       "  \"LIKES:The Plot: A plot like this has the potential to be too extreme or get lost in one factor that everything else tumbles. Thankfully, The Woman King has succeeded on many fronts with a successful presentation. While nothing revolutionary that we haven't seen before, this film really takes a tired story and sharpens it into a spear of many elements that pulled me into the mix. The battle for slavery in the colony days holds many horrors and the movie really shows how one can make a film about fighting the horrors without going Disney on it. Amidst the overall plot are various subplots that focus on the kingdom aspect, which though not fully fleshed out like Game of Thrones, again holds great management with the time they have, establishing a good pace. It forges a community quite well, and that is the central pillar for this film to work with.The Character Focus/Utilization: Much of the story's strength comes from the fantastic character focus of the story, and utilizing many people in the right amounts. True, Viola Davis is a main character, but the writers and director managed to extend the stories to other warriors that help give you more characters to attach too. Outside the woman warrior components, other factions hold their own merit, such as the King himself by Boyega, the evil ruler of the opposing empire, and even the love interest that forms later on in the movie. While not the most balanced, it again, keeps the components very well involved and helps spice up the tale we've heard so much.The Cultural Aspect: Taking those characters and throwing them into a cultural tale was a brilliant choice for me. The Woman King will give you plenty of tribal activities to study and adore, finding themselves potentially captivated by the community's use of song, dance, chanting, and other rituals. Some might be hard, boring, or boastful, I'll admit that when they get a little long, but overall, very impressed with the cultural integration piece to establish the setting.The Music: Another immersive element, this movie's film score holds two primary styles that might help get you into the setting they designed. No surprise, there is a lot of what sounds like African Tribal music to the works, the drums, shakers, and a few horns helping to give you that stereotypical sound the Lion King made famous for many of us. It works very well in the cultural settings and sometimes extends to other moments that describe the pain well. My favorite was the orchestral work, and there are moments where the theater's system amplify that sound to a very, very, high degree to sell that epic moment. Great use of music.The Acting: No surprise, the movie has done very well to make the characters come to life in ways I had hoped they would. Not quite in your face feminist and tough, as many things choose to do, this tribe kicks major butt in the female led cast. Lynch is probably one of my favorite characters in this story, her balance is nice to see, and she shows so much in her ability to extend across emotional spectra to make a very realistic character. Young actress Mbedu crushed her role as well, getting a lot more spotlight than I had anticipated, but for the most part gets her acting down pat, including hysterical cries. I quite enjoyed her determination, but again the fact that she was not perfect was an incredible display of direction and restraint to again make fun characters. Of course, Davis is the star of the show and no surprise, she crushes it again. In what might be my favorite role of hers, at least in a while, Davis unleashes the tough woman attitude she wields so well, but then manages to pull some it back and open up her vulnerability. As the movie goes on, she may not cover quite as many levels of emotion her compatriots do, but somehow takes her angle and makes it work so well given the position of her character. Needless to say, but I will anyway, the chemistry is top notch and that's the successful part of all this ordeal is how well they work together.The Costumes/Make Up: We aren't turning the women into orcs, elves, or donkeys, but they are transforming them into the tribal warriors of a kingdom. This film's use of costume and makeup is subtle, looking like something from a play, but again works so well in what it accomplishes. I loved the warrior looks, I loved the settlers rugged clothes showing struggle, but entitlement, and I loved the makeup evolution deepening on the scene as it brought those cultural moments to life for me.The Setting: Small shot at this, but wow were the shots beautiful of the coast and plateaus of the kingdom. I'm not sure about all the set pieces and CGI work given the blend to this film, but the cinematography at moments is breath taking to see the world to such a degree as what they got.The Action: By far my favorite part of the movie, the action of this film proves for the most part that we still have directors who understand dances of death. The Woman King has at least four action scenes I would call worth it, with a few micro moments to fill in the gap. In these moments, you get different feels for the moment, and the variety works very well to give these moments more of a reason than what many actors do. And in almost all the fights, the choreography is insanely good, with acting, moves, and stunt work blending together to really give the warrior's edge. I loved so much about this movie's battling, especially the epic fight about 75% of the way through the movie and feel that the bar is raised again for action choreography to follow.DISLIKES:A Little Scattered: The movie's plot is not perfect though, and like so many films requires more time to really capitalize on all the stories they tried to tell. The Woman King jumps around a bit at times, with several transitions diluted, or limited to these quick asides that in the grand scheme of things did very little to elevate the story. Not being mean, but so many stories does often lead to incomplete usage and there were potential stories that needed more fluff.John Boyega's Accent: It's a bit cheesy, it's a bit forced, but that doesn't mean I hate it. Boyega does his best with the accent given, and it's not as cheesy as some might have you believe. However, there were better ways to take the character if I'm being honest.The Villains Are A Bit Simplified/Extreme: What this means is that the Woman King's great character development arc did not extend to the antagonists of the film quite as well. Where Nanisca, Nawi, and Izogie hold so many layers to them, the other guys are just simply extreme bad guys that are lightning rods of hate to put your ire against. In addition the stereotypical moments really shine in these characters and I had liked more time to give them some depth given the power they held.Some Hard To Watch Moments: Pertinent to the story? Yes they are, but that does not make some of the moments easy to watch if you can't handle the unfortunate truth of those times. Sensitive fans need to prep themselves for some hard to watch moments that might make the bile in your gut rise. I won't say much, but you've been warned that some details might be hard to watch.The Final Fight is Poetic, But Not As Climactic: After the amazing fights and usage of the story elements, the final fight was a little bit of a letdown for me if I'm being honest. Sure, there are great moves at times, and there is a bit of edge to the madness, including some awesome moments of justice. But that fight before it was a thousand times better and I had liked a little more f that same coordination to make it feel like the film had not been rushed. Again, it has its own element and feel, but that last fight with so many things happening could have used a touch more time and planning for me to really call it the fantastic end it deserved.The VERDICT:\\nThe Woman King had a lot of potential to be another political movie, but what I got was a great balance of many things that just needed more time to be perfected. While female led, there are plenty of other characters with side stories that work together quite well. It's a movie that pulls culture, visuals, costumes, and acting together to really create the tribe you expect to see. And the pacing of the tale, especially the utilization of action, might be some of the best I've seen in a very, very, very, long time. Sure, handling so much resulted in some stories not having the same kick I wanted to see, and there are shortcuts taken to compact it to 120 minutes like it wanted to do. However, the movie really did make a great theater experience for me and is worth the trip if you've got the time. My favorite movie of the three I watched, this reviewer gives The Woman King:Action/Drama/History: 9.0\\nMovie Overall: 8.0-8.5.\"],\n",

       "  'The Woman King is a scintillating portrayal of powerful women protectors driving change in one of world history\\'s most pivotal and often heart-rending times: the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Yet even through the beautifully-filmed and well-choreographed battle scenes, moments of love triumph and make this film worth watching.Set in the 19th century in the West African kingdom of Dahomey, The Woman King follows the all-female group of warriors, the Agojie, and their general, Nanisca (Viola Davis) as they fight, not just against the rival Oyo and Mahi tribes, but foreigners who wish to destroy their way of life and take their people. Along the way, Nanisca must grapple with her past... and Nawi (Thuso Mbedo), a young girl among the ranks of the Agojie who turns out to shape Nanisca\\'s future.Director Gina Prince-Bythewood outdoes herself. Beyond being a film that does its bit to rectify historical exclusion of African narratives in Hollywood, The Woman King is a superb crowd-pleaser, with familiar thematic beats of moralism, love, and community and a fresh-enough take on the \"historical war film.\" The sets transport viewers to pre-colonial Benin, and the cinematography, especially the use of light (inside the palace barracks) and color (the earthy tones of Dahomey\\'s villages), further enhances the viewing experience. The background score by Lebo M. And Terence Blanchard draws on traditional West African music. It\\'s simply goosebump-inducing to watch the Agojie charge into battle accompanied by soulful singing and the djembe and marimba. Good Lord - can Viola Davis do no wrong? The highly-proclaimed actress is perfect for the role of the ruthless, defensive, protective leader; the emotional depth Davis taps into is frankly impressive. She hits all the notes - trauma survivor, bereaved mother, sister in arms - impeccably. Davis\\' character\\'s more conservative, regimented, typically \"top brass\" attributes are beautifully offset by Thuso Mbedo\\'s portrayal of Nawi, the newest recruit who seems to challenge every rule so carefully enforced by Nanisca (and isn\\'t afraid to confront Nanisca as an \"arrogant old woman\"). Nawi and Nanisca\\'s relationship flowers in a way that will make viewers say \"aww\" and though the two tussle every so frequently, the duo becomes the most lovable part of the film - a tough contest. A close second favorite is Izogie (Lashana Lynch), a more experienced member of the Agojie, who is equal parts hilarious, profound, and sweet. My favorite line of Izogie\\'s is essentially, \"We all have a lot to cry about; it is better to laugh.\"The Woman King promotes liberty, staying true to yourself, standing up for what is right, keeping your head held high (but your arrogance in check), obeying authority while also making wise decisions for yourself, and protecting those you love. Nanisca fights against King Ghezo\\'s (John Boyega) vision to sell their prisoners of war to the Europeans for guns and other \"valuable\" goods, acting as a strong voice against racism and the commodification of humans.I give The Woman King 5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

I also hope the film gets an award for \"Best Score\", as the music is its own living thing. It had me tapping in my seat, and feeling the moment as it happened on screen. In addition to Davis, I loved seeing the performances of Lashana Lynch and John Boyega, but also everyone chosen to play in this film embodied their roles to perfection.This film has definitely landed itself in my top three of the year, and perhaps even my number one! Everyone will have their own judgement on the film, but I hope you feel as much of an incredible story and adventure as I did.Overall, this film is 100% worth seeing in theatres.

Pretty solid acting, enunciating and timing with just about all the characters; both many and few adding to the overall depth of the movie.

I left the movie feeling conflicted, heading into it I thought it was going to be an exaggerated showing of black excellence or female power, it sorta was but this was more carefully portrayed. It was adrenaline pumping with a lot of action that was spread out to allow time for story and plot. It's slightly predictable though because the characters had threadbare personalities hence easy to read, once they were given an introduction you could deduce a lot of how their stories, hence the movie's as well, were going to unfold.It should have had a higher rating than pg13 though, because even though there was a lot of bloody fight scenes there wasn't much blood or gore; the fights were well choreographed so I'm not complaining much, the gory could have just made it better.As I said, the accent really annoyed me, other than that Viola Davis put in another strong performance, one of which we've become accustomed to by her so that was great casting. John boyega and Hero Fiennes Tiffin too, the latter with a role not usually associated with him. Lashana Lynch had the same problem as her previous roles were she slightly overdoes the tough guy role but the internet rushes to her defense claiming it's people who just don't like a strong black lead or something.If you think about it, it's not a story you haven't heard, only thing setting it apart is it's based in Africa during slavery and for that will probably get a cult like reception from some due to the message it carries, breaking chains and all. Not perfect but still pretty decent and worth a watch.\"],\n",

       "  \"Despite this movie having a basic plot description for what happens in this movie, trust me when I say the story for this movie is incredible. The story of this movie doesn't just tell this story of a female-led army but serves up two different purposes. The first purpose of the story of this movie is to help bring light to this piece of history. Before this movie came out or even the trailer how many people actually knew about this kingdom and army? Probably not many people who aren't from that area of the world or from the culture. This is why this story is so incredible because even though most of what you're seeing is false it still makes you want to look up and learn more about the Dahomey and the Agojie. The movie's story does a great job of hocking the audience along for this journey and showing just how badass these women were. This brings me to the second purpose of this movie's story which is to show and empower women to be warriors. Recently Hollywood has been getting better at showing stories of women as more than just a side character and The Woman King thankfully joins those ranks. This movie does not hold back when showing how tough these women are in comparison to the men and it's amazing. Due to this movie having a majority female cast it wasn't the hardest task to show how strong women are and especially show younger girls how strong they can be. Another part of this movie's story I really enjoyed was the African culture it included. I have to admit I'm not the right person to talk about African culture so I can't say how accurate it is but it was still interesting to see it included in this movie during the downtime between action scenes.But despite the incredible story of this movie the pacing for this movie is kind of weird. From the beginning of the movie to the end there is no clear passage of time so it's hard to tell how much time has passed. One second they're training the new recruits and the next it's the final test for the new recruits. This really isn't a big deal and doesn't take away from the movie as a whole but it kind of irks me. I would've loved to have seen them training more and seeing how they become to be these mighty warriors instead of some of the other scenes in this movie that easily could've been cut down or out of the movie and nothing would've changed. But it was hard to tell there were pacing issues when the acting for this movie was spectacular. Obviously one of the biggest names that's in this movie is Viola Davis, who plays Nanisca, and man does she steal the show. Viola Davis plays this no-nonsense leader who just cares about the people in her army while still showing some vulnerability. It's incredible to see her switch between being this serious leader and then showing vulnerability when she's around her closest friend. Another actress who stood out to me was Lashana Lynch, who plays Izogie. Lashana Lynch at first appears like she's going to be the comedic relief for this movie and in some ways she is but she also brings some humanity to this movie as well. With Izogie she shows how somebody can be this tough person on the outside but still be caring to those close to her. The last person I want to shout out is Sheila Atim, who plays Amenza. She doesn't get much screen time unfortunately but whenever she was on screen she was great. All of the actors in this movie did amazing jobs and helped bring the audience into this compound. I just want to quickly say if you ever get bored while watching this movie and Hero Fiennes Tiffin, who plays Santo Ferreira, is ever on the screen keep count of how many times he breaks his accent because trust me it happens quite often.With this movie being an action movie the pressure is on for the action scenes to be good and thankfully the action scenes in this movie kickass. All of the fighting in this movie is so well choreographed and knows how best to show off the strengths of each character in combat. The most impressive part of the action scenes is the knowledge that the actors all did their own stunts which helps bring the audience into the fights as well. What also helps with fight scenes is the framing and directing of the scenes to make sure they're easy to follow and Gina Prince-Bythewood, the director, did just that. The action scenes still had some edits put in to change the camera angle but you can tell that the directing for those scenes was to make them as clean and in focus as possible. But it wasn't just the fight scenes the directing was great during but the movie as a whole was directed so well. You can see how much passion Gina Prince-Bythewood had for this project and how she wanted to make sure the story was told and seen. Before I wrap this up I just want to rapid-fire shout out some other elements I loved from this movie due to how much it dived into African culture which are the costume designs, production design and the music, done by Terence Blanchard. In the end, The Woman King might not be fully truthful to the real Agojie army but this movie does an incredible job of making people want to learn about them. This is an important movie to check out, especially for women and probably will be an award-season favourite.\"],\n",

       "  'It\\'s been a minute since my last trip to the movie theater, there just hasn\\'t been anything that sparked my interest. A sentiment apparently not just my own. The manager at my theater of choice told me they\\'ve been opening late in the day since there hasn\\'t been anything to draw folks in. I fully expected this to continue to be the case unit at least next month until I stumbled across an Instagram post by Viola Davis for The Woman King about a 19th century elite group of female African warriors. Real life Dora Milaje, not only starring but also produced by Davis and her husband? No doubt I HAD to see this film.The short and sweet of it? The Woman King is an exceptional movie.Period.Superb acting lead by the incomparable Viola Davis is just the start.Rising star Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, and Lashana Lynch match Davis\\' power, ferocity, humanity, and emotion creating the heart/soul/core of the film. Their chemistry and interaction are mesmerizing and the solid foundation that the film is built upon.Dana Stevens and Maria Bello\\'s script is rock solid and perfectly encapsulates all the strength, warmth, humor, pain, triumph, joy etc. That so many \"female\" based stories tend to lack and services both the story and actors beautifully. The richness this script has is a true rarity.Having Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love and Basketball and The Secret Lives of Bees) in the director\\'s chair is an added bonus. The opening sequence had me glued to the screen and I couldn\\'t look away the entire film. Fair warning, the action sequences are brutal and glorious, completely unwavering in their ferocity.The cinematography, musical score, sets, and direction all on point. The layering elevates the entire viewing experience.The Woman King is not just 2 hours 15 minutes of Viola Davis and company kicking ass (thought that wouldn\\'t be a bad thing) it\\'s a grown up, character driven triumph that transports viewers to pre-colonial Benin in a fresh take on historical war films. I can easily risk over hyping from my own enthusiasm, and risk underselling for fear of saying too much. So, I say, if you have the slightest interest in this one, just go. The Woman King needs to be seen/experienced on the big screen. It has all the feels, powerful messaging, and humanity/community we can all use right now.The Woman King is a 10.'],\n",

The film has received plenty of scrutiny already, both from people skeptical that it could offer an accurate portrait of Africans\\' role in atrocities and those looking for a beacon of light to be shone on a misunderstood people and their history.\"I knew what it would mean to us as Black people,\" said the film\\'s star, Viola Davis, in an interview with Vanity Fair. \"Something that has never been done before. And what it would mean for Black women sitting in that movie theater. The responsibility is high.\"The Women King rejects the notion that its responsibility is to teach African history in two hours. Instead, it tells a tale of pride, dignity, and agency against the backdrop of the fascinating Dahomey tribe. In short: With a stellar cast, filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood (who wrote for A Different World and directed Love & Basketball and The Old Guard) brings the legendary Agoji warrior women to life.Davis does an amazing job of playing Davis, without ever seeming to embody the persona of a stoic African warrior. Lucky for the film, this hardly matters. The sheer force she brings as an actor provides the essential emotional beats that a more authentic portrayal might have asked her to sacrifice.Meanwhile, the supporting cast of fellow warriors accomplish an astonishing amount of characterization through slight looks and limited dialogue that distinguish each of them within the unit. But the breakout star is the young Thuso Mbedu, who plays the headstrong recruit Nawi.At the beginning of the film, Nawi is a teenage girl being married off by her caregiver. Vigorously resistant to the choice being made for her, she\\'s sent to live and train with the Agoji warriors, where she is to take no lovers and bear no children (it\\'s not unlike joining the Night\\'s Watch in Game of Thrones). She\\'s stubborn, but her desire to be a warrior drives her through brutal trials-and helps her become a proud warrior.Set in 1823, The Woman King finds the Dahomey in a cyclical conflict with a neighboring tribe, enriching themselves with the sale of each other\\'s prisoners to the international slave trade-and King Ghezo (John Boyega) of the Dahomey is being pressured to abandon the practice.The tribe\\'s most passionate advocate for forsaking the slave trade is Nanisca (Davis), the general who leads the Agoji, which is Ghezo\\'s fiercest fighting force. Her previous experience in slavery traumatized her to the point of clarity, convincing her that the Dahomey must break from the system they\\'ve chained themselves to before the tribes devastate each other.The brutality on display in the tribal war is measured. This is PG-13, after all, and that may be the one thing holding The Woman King back from being an epic, as opposed to merely a very good film (the filmmakers seem to have chosen accessibility over a fiercely accurate, R-rated depiction of war and slavery).This is in line with Roland Emmerich\\'s \"historical\" Revolutionary War film The Patriot (2000). Both movies use loosely tied-together backstories within an authentic setting, while shoehorning an egregious love story into the plot (again, chalk it up to the accessibility factor).The Woman King sidesteps the accusations of its loudest prerelease critics, who demanded that all warts be shown in its depiction of the French and African tribes and the slave trade. The trailer elicited quite the backlash from people who claimed that the film would depict the \"noble\" Africans murdering their \"evil\" white oppressors.Not so much, it turns out. In The Woman King, the Africans are shown with relative historical accuracy concerning their own brutal war tactics, slavery for profit, and attitudes towards women. And as for the French slavers, they\\'re not demonized beyond the understanding that the slave trade existed.In other words, The Women King is directed at a Black audience, but it\\'s a movie for everybody. And if its existence causes people with racial animus to inadvertently study African history? Cool.Ray Gill Jr-Willamette Week.'],\n",

The fight scenes in particular were essentially uninspired and typical, and over edited. For the first third or so, I couldn't always make out a word at time like the sound mix was bad, though could always be the theater sound system itself. I also felt the runtime a bit, which for a guy who loves The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Rober Ford is saying something. Maybe lose 15 min, mostly 1 unnecessary sub plot. The aforementioned editing didn't help in this area either.It looked like much of the outdoor photography at least was shot Africa, big plus. The actors are all in. Boyega nails his part without overdoing it as a king. The main warrior women are interesting and very distinguishable. All did terrific jobs and sell being great warriors, especially the ones playing veterans. They all seem invested and help make the movie worth it.Big positive: if you're looking for a movie going for woke points, this isn't the movie for you, meaning go see it. You'll learn something. The main conflict is dealing directly with the internal problem of Africans slave trading other Africans. It's the main point. Even the 'good guy' tribe is dealing with having sold its own, and are the good guys because they desire to turn from that path, not because they are unrealistic flawless idealists.The white slavers do play a small part, and are Portuguese slavers from Brazil; another welcome touch.The realistic way they dealt with the issues is the film's saving grace and it deserves to be seen to show Hollywood that black actors deserve more than to be randomly chucked in as Achilles or Nordic chiefs for social points. Plus, negatives aside it is pretty good and worth seeing. Give this film your money, it deserves it.\"],\n",

(I\\'ll get to this later.)Unfortunately, aside from the committed performances from most of the cast (especially Viola Davis), this is also one of the clunkiest narratives I\\'ve seen put to screen in some time.The romantic subplot is rushed and entirely without substance or feeling. The central young woman Nawi supposedly has a traumatic past that we are barely told about, and she has no character growth at all. She wants to be a soldier, so she does. She\\'s arrogant and disobedient at the beginning of the film and continues to be like this to the end.Davis\\'s character Nanisca has an arc-at least on paper. She is emotionally closed off due to trauma and then decides not to be. But this change happens within two minutes of screen time and occurs off screen. It\\'s kind of hilarious how unearned it is.The story has no actual fleshed-out antagonist. There are a couple of villainous persons but their goals are vague at best and cartoonish at worst.All this could occasionally fall to the wayside if the action sequences were good. But this film has some of the worst action I\\'ve seen put to film this year.Nearly all of the fight scenes are exceptionally clumsy in how they\\'re shot and edited. Far more often than not, the shots consist of our heroes swinging at someone off screen or so visibly for away from them that it\\'s obvious to anyone with functioning depth perception that no actual strike took place.Equally as often is the occasional shot in which the enemy soldiers literally-and hilariously-just patiently stand there waiting for the good gals to come take them down.Okay, now for the elephant in the theater: the insulting historical \"basis\" for the film.For a movie that wants to bemoan the evils of colonialism, the filmmakers really are colonializing the culture of nineteenth century west Africa.How? By paving over the Dahomey\\'s centuries-old historical acts of human sacrifice and voluntary brutal enslavement of both their own and foreign people. The writers slap their 21st century feminism on top of a historically brutal culture and call it a day.In reality, the Dahomey would have scoffed at the idea of ending the slave trade, as they only stopped trading slaves in the mid-19th century because the British forced them to stop. But this film depicts most of them as freedom-fighting abolishionists and acts as though the slave trade didn\\'t exist until Europeans invented it. This is nonsense.Imagine if there were a film made today about the American civil war in which the confederates were portrayed as freedom-fighting abolishionists who had slavery forced upon them by the north.This would be rightly condemned, so why aren\\'t people enraged at the convenient erasure of uncomfortable history that is propagated by this film?It\\'s a largely incompetent piece of filmmaking, and it\\'s an insulting, culturally offensive piece of writing.It\\'s shameful.'],\n",

But because I've almost always appreciated and liked the roles that Viola Davis chooses, I gave it a try.After Viola Davis declarations about what it would mean if people didn't went to see the movie, a big part of me wanted nothing more than to not even see the movie. But I took her statements, as her making a huge mistake, that might hurt an actual good movie.And as it turned out, I wouldn't have lost anything if I hadn't watched this movie.From Viola Davis, to Lashana Lynch Izogie and others. The performances were for the most part solid, and the natural beauty of the African continent all helped to make the movie tolerable.However try as they might, and they did try, history didn't happened that way. Not exactly. The Woman King gives you the Hollywood edited version of history, but it doesn't give you the actual history. The ugly side of the tribe that Nanisca (Davis) is portraying.It's understandable why they did what they did, seeing the times they were living, and the movie should've owned that, instead of trying to embellish the truth. Anyone with an ounce of common sense would've understood, or at least tried to understand what was happening historically in that period of African history.But apparently they are too ashamed to own to their own history. Maybe because the actresses and actors, didn't even bother to study the history of what they were going to be portraying.The movie is not good, not really. It's watchable, not just because of the performances but also because of the beauty of the African continent, and also in part the culture as well. However they could've cut twenty minutes to the movie and you'd have lost nothing.It has too many moments that are slow paced, and then it just puts in the fifth gear and doesn't slow down. To the viewer that doesn't know anything about what they're watching, they might be deceived into thinking they saw a a movie about female empowerment, and how to fight against oppression to preserve one's freedom. Because that's what the movie tries to sell.And it's really because of the embellishment of a hard reality, that was the reality of those times, that I couldn't really appreciate this movie. It would be like applauding inaccuracy for the sake of creating a nice story, instead of owning the truth and show how many times sacrifices and hard choices need to be made.I completely understand how some people might be more than willing to close their eyes to those things, but the dual standard isn't lost considering other historical movies were also a target of great scrutiny. And if memory fails you, then remember the criticism done about Kingdom of Heaven for not accurately portraying the Islamic side of history.So if all other historical movies have been subjected to critic of their historical accuracy, then The Woman King doesn't get a free pass. At least not from me.And then there's the story of the movie itself. Completely predicable from beginning to end, some of the dialogues were cringe as cringe can be, and some actresses like Viola Davis tried to sell their roles so hard that it came out as far over the top.Twelve Years a Slave was a great movie, however The Woman King is not. It's watchable in a way that you can see it and pass the time, but without ever getting pulled into the story.This movie will add nothing to the career of the actresses and actors in it. And it will add little to viewer, that spends the 135 minutes watching it.And so there's no doubts, this movie lost me because a) the story wasn't good enough b) the story is too predictable c) some performances are just too over the top and d) the historical inaccuracy is unforgivable.\"],\n",

But to take a tribe that were notoriously bad as warriors, and noted as incredibly happy to sell people into the slave trade, probably was as an ignorant miss as you could get at this time.

I will say straight away that I intensely dislike films that have an agenda and are incredibly historically inaccurate as a result, e.g., Braveheart, 300, The Patriot. However, I can easily accept and enjoy films a bit historically inaccurate as films primarily exist to entertain, i.e., most Hollwood historical films.Unfortunately, TWK falls into the former category. If they had stuck to the real story, then it could have been an interesting film about a little-known African Kingdom, particularly with the lovely images of Africa. Instead, they decided to make it as a black female empowerment, anti-European propaganda piece. Sure, slavery is central to the film but with a twist, in that slavery was in place to make money from Europeans, for which Dahomey reluctantly supplied slaves to feed a European need. The truth is that Africans had been supplying slaves for thousands of years to Arabs, Egyptians, Romans, etc, and keeping hundreds of thousands for themselves. Europeans had a relatively 'short' involvement with the African slave trade, and Europe's largest contribution (primarily British) was to end the African slave trade, against the wishes of African kings and slave traders. The female warriors are shown as some sort of Spartan elite, which they were not, as they primarily attacked and seized women and children as slaves and were easily defeated by the French in hand-to-hand combat. In fact, the French lost 6 soldiers killed whilst the Dahomey warriors, including the female 'elite', lost many hundreds killed. The female warriors and their general were misrepresented in the same way that the Waffen SS would be misrepresented if portrayed as peace-loving pacifists!A good film could have been made of court intrigue or the impact of Dahomey slavers on raided villages, but no, propaganda and politics rules the roost in Hollywood.\"],\n",

Highly recommend watching this in a theatre if it's playing anywhere near you. This movie is gorgeous enough to watch on the big screen.This movie really just has a lot of emotion that's been missing from movies these days. I think a lot of people are really glad that movie theatres are back after two years of lockdowns and mandates, but there's been so much great stuff coming out that's made being a movie goer exciting again.

       "  'Greetings again from the darkness. I seriously doubt that I\\'ll ever skip a Cate Blanchett movie. She\\'s won two Oscars and has been nominated six times. She\\'s consistently the best part of her movies, and often the best in a full year of movies. Here she stars in the first film in 16 years from the remarkable writer-director Todd Field. His two previous films, LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) and IN THE BEDROOM (2001) combined for eight Oscar nominations, and more importantly, established Mr. Field as a rare and unique filmmaker of great depth. Having Field reappear and cast Blanchett generated a heap of excitement from this film nerd.Ms. Blanchett stars as Lydia Tar, a piano virtuoso, the conductor of the famed Berlin Orchestra, and a true musical genius. She\\'s a rare EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) from the classical field. Her music (and her life) is a quest to uncover/discover what the composer meant with each piece. Lydia is sometimes rough on her wife Sharon (Nina Hoss), but frequently dotes on their young daughter ... while otherwise living a relative selfish and self-centered life. We also see this true persona in how she treats her young assistant Francesca (Noemie Merlant), who quietly aspires to become a conductor, while efficiently keeping Lydia on track each day.The film begins with \"New Yorker\" writer Adam Gopnik interviewing Lydia as a stage presentation in front of a live audience. It\\'s his introduction of the Maestra where we learn her background and the proficiency that has garnered her such respect (as well as jealousy and animosity). Throughout the film, many real musicians (past and present) are referenced, and that detailed research is alone enough to earn respect for what Mr. Field has accomplished here. The stress and laser-focus on Lydia as she prepares for the final symphony in her Mahler portfolio (his 5th). We witness the meticulous detail that goes into managing the music and musicians, and this leads to handling the dismissal of veteran who is slipping, and the addition of a brilliant young cellist named Olga (Sophie Kauer). We are never quite sure if Lydia\\'s attraction to Olga is limited to her skills with the bow.Of course, any perfectionist at the top of their industry is subject to backlash and criticism. Is Lydia abusive? Is she exploitive? It seems the answers may be affirmative, and likely what drives her art. It\\'s quite discomforting to watch as she covers her tracks after the suicide of a former pupil, but I\\'ll admit to a certain feeling of satisfaction as she verbally spars with another student over gender semantics ... actions that of course come back to bite her.Ms. Blanchett is fascinating and mesmerizing to watch. She is at the top of her game playing a perfectionist who is at the top of her game. However, it\\'s clear this film isn\\'t likely to strike the right notes with mainstream audiences. It\\'s an arthouse film about art, and thus is filled with dialogue and much less actual music than you might expect for a film about a world class Orchestra conductor.Opens in theaters on October 21, 2022.'],\n",

I believe that people studying an art form have an obligation to understand and engage with the full history of that art form, even when it\\'s made by people who identify very differently from them. I believe that 99% of people accused of misdeeds are guilty to some extent of those misdeeds. I believe that there are many people who seek to avoid engaging with complex ideas and perspectives that challenge them and make them uncomfortable. I believe that everyone is guilty at times of making sweeping generalizations about others. I believe that there are positive things we can learn from people who might be terrible in other ways. I believe that both people participating voluntarily in a transactional relationship bear responsibility for the outcomes of that relationship. I believe that people are incredibly complex and can be many things at once. I believe we live in a social media world that more and more doesn\\'t want to acknowledge that and wants to be able to smack an easy meme and label on everything.What does \"Tar\" -- the movie, not the character -- believe? Maybe all of the above. Maybe none of the above. The beauty of \"Tar\" is that it raises a host of complex questions but doesn\\'t force any answers on the viewer. This is a movie made for adults that lets us think for ourselves. A lot of people are interpreting it as an examination of cancel culture. I can see why, though that isn\\'t how I primarily interpreted it. I don\\'t think it\\'s as much about the rights and wrongs of cancel culture as much as it\\'s about our complicated relationships with artists and the art they create. The movie isn\\'t exclusively about Americans, but the writer and director Todd Field is, so I think it\\'s also about how the only thing Americans enjoy more than turning someone into an unrealistic hero is to rip them apart when they fail to live up to our expectations.This is a movie I cannot stop thinking about. I didn\\'t love it, though I liked it a lot. There\\'s something slightly cold about it, so while I enjoyed the intellectual rigors of it, I didn\\'t feel very emotionally involved. I started to feel its length as it moved into its final scenes.

       "  'Lydia Tar seems to have it all. As she is introduced in an interview that opens the film, she is music director of a prestigious Berlin orchestra (and the world-leading female conductor), music composer, winner of the EGOT, and founder of an institute to train female conductors, etc. At home, she has a female partner, and together they are raising a child who is fond of her. But some past incidents come to haunt her.Cate Blanchette is mentioned a lot in earlier reviews for her acting, and I agree that she gives an excellent, believable performance in the role. However, there is more than acting that goes into a film. There is the story.One thread running thru the film is her rehearsals of the Mahler 5th Symphony. This is supposed to be her crowning achievement in recording, completing the full cycle of 9 Mahler symphonies with the same orchestra, in a covid-delayed live recording. I assume that the 5th was chosen for plot purposes, rather than a larger one with requirements for a choir, and also short enough to require a companion piece. Again, I assume for plot purposes, the selection of a companion piece was delayed until rehearsals for the 5th were almost complete, rather than being programmed a lot earlier, and a soloist (if needed) hired.As a donor to my local symphony, and so a seasoned attendee at rehearsals, I find the rehearsals authentic. That includes decisions like tempo, the balance between sections of the orchestra, and moving the opening trumpet solo offstage. Intriguingly, when Tar speaks to the orchestra in German, subtitles are omitted, which somewhat parallels the experience of being at a rehearsal, since the audience does not hear all of what the conductor is saying.At over 2-1/2 hours, the film is long, but reasonable. There is a sub-plot showing a different part of her world collapsing on her. Move importantly, her character has time to develop to show that the accusation against her are credible. There are mentions of real-world conductors being fired for sexual improprieties, but casting all-female principals nicely strips the gender differences away, leaving it to simply power and opportunity.'],\n",

Very.The first seven minutes are dedicated to scrolling the film's credits. No, not credits for Kate Blanchette and the rest of the cast. I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik. The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I coul;d not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations.

       "  'Lately, I\\'ve been trying to enter into movies as unspoiled as possible--no trailers, no reviews, no news. This strategy has greatly improved my enjoyment of movies, I think. In the case of TAR, I went in knowing that it was about a controversial female conductor trying to put together a difficult symphony. I also, for some reason, was convinced that it was based on a true story--an illusion that the film itself in no way dispelled. Was it unusual to be seeing a biopic about such very recent events in the life of a living person? Sure. Was it refreshingly bold that the film seemed to hold no punches in its portrayal of its real life protagonist? Absolutely, but that seemed to fit what Lydia Tar would want. I imagined her giving her full endorsement to a film that exposed both her phenomenal talent and her most despicable flaws. Was I confused by the apparent artistic license that director Todd Field must have taken when choosing to reveal intimate private details that contradicted what was being told to the public? Sure, but this is art! Was it a bit mind blowing that I had never heard about some of the newsworthy events in the film? Well, yes and no--for one, I kinda remembered reading about that climax in The Atlantic last summer, and for another, well, what the hell do I know about the world of classical music? I can\\'t tell you the name of any conductor, living or dead, world famous or not. For hours after seeing the film, I had no idea that it was not a fairly accurate account of real recent events.Todd Field has created a masterpiece. The world he has captured feels utterly believable. The jargon-laden conversations, so frequently peppered with charged opinions about esoteric ephemera; the complete lack of anything that feels expository or explanatory; the magnificent embodiment of these characters by Cate Blanchett, Nina Hoss, Noemie Merlant, and the others, so evocative of real lived emotions and back stories and contradictions; the atmospheric realism to every setting, prop, and costume: everything about this film seems suggestive of nonfiction, as though Todd Field and the other filmmakers were able to convey this international ecosystem of elite musical performance so convincingly because they were simply copying details, interviews, and footnotes that already existed. It is simply astounding that this screenplay is an original creation; its level of immersive realism surpasses anything else I can think of.The cinematography by Florian Hoffmeister, the editing by Monika Willi, and the work accomplished by their sound team likewise contribute to this impressive illusion. The camerawork in the opening scene so effectively places us in Lydia\\'s New Yorker interview with the real life Adam Gopnik as he enumerates the many accomplishments on her CV that the enunciation of her bio becomes a hypnotic spell ferrying us into the alternate reality on the screen. Other scenes capture gestures, tics, expressions, and glances that add infinite subtext and subversion to what is happening on screen.Towards the end of the film, a 1958 recording of Tar\\'s mentor Leonard Bernstein explains to us \"what music means\" and how it\\'s infinitely more layered and meaningful than our verbal communication. This is illustrated throughout the film, showing a woman of humble beginnings who has mastered not just English but apparently several vocabularies and yet often uses those precise words to conceal, to obfuscate, to abuse, to disorient, and to terrorize. Most of what she says often comes across as inauthentic, dishonest, pretentious, or performative except when the subject is musical expression, which she truly seems to intuit and love. At times, you\\'ll want subtitles to fully understand her hypereducated and superspecialized speech; if you can\\'t keep up, it\\'s only proof that she belongs in the ivory towers and you do not. Sometimes literal subtitles are needed (and not always provided) to fully understand the multilingual conversations, although the sense of the language can be appreciated simply from the sounds and delivery. When Tar tosses out ten-dollar words like \"misogamist\" in the midst of an argument in order to simultaneously belittle, confuse, and derail her opponent, one sees the ways in which education can be used simultaneously as a weapon and as armor. Beneath her venomous loquaciousness cowers an insecure frailty. Ignore the mask, the identity, the performance of self, Tar seems to beg--only the music matters.That is, in fact, her literal argument in one very captivating scene early in the film. During a screed against identity politics, she effectively asserts that art must be separated from the artist--a stance which the remainder of the film then troubles to the utmost. The movie engages in the cultural politics of today with full complexity, refusing easy answers or the clear taking of sides.There is a lot to unpack in this beautiful, artful, and provocative film. I imagine many audience members will be turned off by its many discomforting choices: forcing us to watch and acknowledge the full credits of all the filmmakers in the crew before beginning the movie, making us empathize with a protagonist whose actions are often contemptible and unforgivable, forcing us to keep up with allusions and references that are often unfamiliar, tantalizing us with glimpses of moments that have no clear purpose or meaning within the structure of the film, and then denying us any of the obvious catharsis that we\\'ve come to expect from our character arc-driven movie structures. Nevertheless, this is a rich, powerful, and moving film that I will certainly be revisiting many times.'],\n",

It takes a VERY long time for it to become clear what the film is actually about, because rather than introducing us to a world and the characters in it, Todd Field puts us right in the mind of an artist and then shows us the things that shape her psyche.No doubt many viewers will find their patience tested to its absolute limit by the elusiveness of the film's purpose. I personally found it riveting, as the dialogue is so sharply written and Lydia is such a fascinating character to dissect from scene to scene.Simple conversations and events are presented to us that do not have any apparent impact on the narrative in the moment. Not until the film's conclusion do the film's many happenings collectively boil over into their tragic and profound purpose.Ambiguity is further compounded by the refusal of Field to give us concrete answers regarding the moral implications of his story.Is Lydia a good or bad person? Was she guilty, and if so, to what degree? Did she deserve her unfortunate fate?These questions have no definitive answers, nor should they. It amplifies either the ironic justice or the ironic tragedy of the narrative, depending on how you look at it.The only complaint I have is the length. Yes, it is too long.

At the film\\'s beginning, we learn several things from an interview with Adam Gopnik (Adam Gopnik). Besides her great musical background, we observe that Lydia has stage fright before performances, but her iron will and quick wit allow her to suppress her inner stress. As the movie unfolds, we learn she is married to Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss), the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic. Her assistant, Francesca Lentini (Noémie Merlant), is also an aspiring conductor and possibly a former lover. Lydia and Sharon have a daughter, Petra (Mila Bogojevic), who has some issues at school.As time passes, we see the darker side of Lydia\\'s personality.

My 7.5/10 is based on the following: 4.5/5 in terms of having all the elements of a good movie: writing, acting, etc., and 3/5 for entertainment value. An interesting aspect of this movie is its commentary on today's social climate.\"],\n",

       "  \"For two hours and thirty eight minutes, Todd Field invites us into the world of Lydia Tár. For those two hours and thirty eight minutes she does not only ask for our attention, she commands it. It is not a film you could put on while you cook or clean, because from the very first frame, you won't want to so much as blink. It demands to be seen, demands to be heard. It may have a runtime that some may find a little daunting, but I didn't want it to end.My expectations for a movie have almost never been higher, but they were completely shattered by this absolute masterpiece.Field directs Tár with such precision and power that every frame is a work of art in itself that were so expertly put together. His script as well is masterful. Probably the best character study I have ever seen, it's an absolute beast. And somehow, even after 2h38 minutes, I wanted more.Lydia Tár is a symbol of power, it is up to us to decide whether or not she deserves the power she holds. We meet her at the peak of her career, teetering on the edge of a great downfall. She does not need to be liked by us, but regardless of if we love or hate her, she has our undivided attention. Lydia is undeniably flawed, and yet we grasp for something redeeming in her, we need her to be worthy of her power.The film doesn't ask us to condemn Tár, but it certainly doesn't want us to root for her. Rather, it shows us the impact and consequences of her actions and grasp on power. It shows us not only the actions she made to get where she is, but also those around her who may try and keep her in power. And it is all electrifying to witness.The score as well is a leading force in this film. The first time we see Lydia conduct, it is absolutely tremendous to hear. It would have been easy to pick any pieces of music to feature in this film and call it a day, but it's clear that every song was purposefully chosen, and does really bring the film to another level. I think when characters interact and control the score in the way they do in Tár is also just magical because you can imagine how it may be different if someone else was in the scene.The entire cast is an absolute force but I think we all know who this movie truly belongs to. Cate Blanchett, who has already had one of the most impressive and prolific acting careers of all time, is at her very best as Lydia Tár. No one else could have possibly played her. Quite frankly may be the greatest performance I have ever seen. I cannot say much about it that hasn't already been said, but she is truly and electric and powerful as everyone has been saying. She disappeared so fully and wholly into the role that there was really no Cate Blanchett in this film at all, only Lydia Tár. Truly a performance that will be talked about for years to come. To occupy almost every single shot of a movie like this is no small undertaking, but Cate Blanchett.... Cate Blanchett man.Nina Hoss is also a marvel to watch. Although her character doesn't hold nearly the presence Tár does, Hoss has no issues keeping up with Blanchett's masterclass, though perhaps more subtlety. Her performance is just as worthy of praise as Blanchett's. I've only seen a couple of her previous works, but I am more than happy to see her breaking in to a more widespread acclaim and I think she may be underestimated throughout awards season.I have not been this entranced by a movie in a long time. Certainly a movie I will watch again and again, and one I will see something new in every time I watch it. Cannot recommend it enough, it is a masterpiece. The movie of the year, maybe the decade. Have not felt this sort of awe towards a movie in years and wrote this all before I could even unhinge my jaw from the floor. Todd Field came back after 16 years and delivered the greatest film he possibly could with Tár. Cannot praise his writing and direction in this enough.\"],\n",

       "  \"I have seen movie two times.I just can't get this movie out of my mind. It's so cerebral, I don't think this movie would have worked with another actors but only Cate Blanchett.She exudes performance mixture of Blue jasmine, Phantom thread, Black swan, Women under the influence.Todd field is an auteur, dialouge rich screen play must have needed lots of deep research. I get why he only wanted Cate Blanchett to play this role. She's mesmerising, even if you don't get the lingo of classical music, she will suck you in her world with her charisma. This movie is really intelligently made and it does not spoon feed you or being didactic about anything even though there are elements like 'cancel culture', 'Metoo' etc. Exist in contemporary sociopolitical zeitgeist. It's a really clever filmmaking. Todd field really took some time and research as I said to make this masterpiece.Cate Blanchett's performance will reverberate in cinematic history for being one the greatest of all. She undoubtedly desereves another Oscar for this tour de force turn. Having also seen Michelle yeoh (EEOAO), Daniel deadwyler (TILL), Michelle Williams(The Fablemans), all incredible in their movies but Cate Blanchett really operating on another level that can not be matched, and it's not Hyperbole. Ms Blanchett really commands the scren, maybe that is why she's considered greatest actor alive, along with Daniel day lewis.Do give this movie a chance, you may find it slow at first but if you let it sink Inuit will take over.\"],\n",

       "  'After a 16-year absence from directing, Todd Field is back with the intellectual character drama \"Tár.\" Rapturously received at festivals and by critics in large part due to Cate Blanchett\\'s leading performance as Lydia Tár, the film has been extremely acclaimed. On the grounds of Blanchett\\'s riveting performance, I would say the acclaim is plenty justified. The rest of the movie, while well-made, skillfully composed and stylistically controlled, did not do quite as much for me as it did for many critics.Blanchett\\'s acting is superb as Tár. She skillfully exhibits an appropriate emotional range while simultaneously making use of an encyclopedic understanding of classical music composing, effortlessly switching back and forth between English and German, and commanding the emphasis of the viewer in nearly every frame of the film that she is in (which, of course, is the overwhelming majority of them.) Todd Field does an outstanding job directing her as well, creating an immersive and clinical atmosphere that may remind viewers--to some extent--of Kubrick. The main plot is primarily about the downfall of Tár, and the plot ends up significantly touching on the theme of so-called \"cancel culture.\" The film handles these themes with care, but could have done so in a more deft manner--and that delicate balance between cinematic carefulness and needing a tighter structure is a lingering issue in the entire movie. At 158 minutes, \"Tár\" is a long movie, but I am not completely certain that it fully justified its length. Field\\'s direction and command of the medium is highly commendable in a general sense, there are a lot of scenes that do nothing to advance the story, its themes, or its characters (such as Tár walking to the refrigerator, etc.) that cumulatively add up into a somewhat-significant amount of material that could have been better edited for the sake of conciseness. While the film is undoubtedly a character study (and a good one at that,) it still could have used a somewhat more structured plot to help complement Lydia Tár\\'s character development. The film\\'s slow pace and methodical, intellectually rigorous modus operandi will definitely not be for everyone. Yet while I didn\\'t love the film in its entirety quite as much as some, I still recommend this to discerning and sophisticated film lovers. 7.5/10.'],\n",

       "  'Tár tackles a simple story concept in a decidedly non-simple and effective way. The movie is dialogue-heavy, with this dialogue largely used to fill in the character of Lydia Tár and lead the audience along a path of discovery. We are shown her passions and flaws, her genius and her ego. As we learn and understand, we are led along a story that is perhaps not surprising, but it is still fascinating to watch as all these competing elements in her come to a head in the climactic moments.Cate Blanchett is once again incredible. She drives the movie and gives such a dominating and twisting performance that I could not look away. The direction and writing seemed quite solid, and the movie was focused on its key story and never wholly lost itself in the random moments. Sound was, unsurprisingly for a movie about a precise composer/conductor, quite important. Whether it was the not-quite-silent nights or the music of a rehersal, sound carried weight throughout and was used most effectively.There were some definite faults and unsuccessful moments, from phones to a mother, but these were few enough to be hardly noticeable in the overall flow. Tár is a provocative movie I am very glad to have watched.'],\n",

This film gave me nothing. If you can appreciate a film for its technical merits alone you may find this movie worthwhile. Cate Blanchett is an amazing actress and performed well. The filmography was good and music performance scenes were believable (at least to someone not classically trained) and sounded amazing. But Blachett's Lydia Tar was an abhorrent person and I had difficulty appreciating any of the characters in the film. If you are a big fan of Blanchett, which I'm guessing many of the reviewers are, you may appreciated this more just because of her performance but I found it to be slow moving and a waste of my time and money. If only my wife had listened to me and we had watched the Rock's new action movie.\"]]"
